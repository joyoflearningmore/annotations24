<td>	 O’Donnell doesn’t see it this way. He argues that birds attending ant raids are not so much competing as coexisting, sharing resources, perhaps even facilitating one another’s participation—deliberately or not. “Having other birds around may be an advantage because there are more eyes and ears to detect predators,” he says. “Food is usually abundant at a raid, so the costs of allowing other birds to attend may be low, favoring more positive interactions.”<br/>			 Anyone who has ever watched a dual between two rufous hummingbirds at a nectar feeder, or a pack of gulls battling for a stray french fry, or a pair of starlings bloodying each other over just about anything knows the potential for fierce competition in the bird world. The common understanding of the struggle for survival is that it’s a fight to the end to win limited resources. As the Dickens character</td>

The behavior occurs in birds that have a brain big for their body size (ravens have among the largest relative brain size of any bird), a long juvenile period when youngsters hang around with their parents (ravens spend at least five months with their family), and a habit of exploiting all available food resources (ravens specialize in being food generalists). Most birds that engage in social play have a complex social system. Ducks do something called coordinated loafing, hanging out together. But real social play exists mostly among birds that live in complex societies where alliances are fluid and constantly shifting, like ravens and Australian magpies.</td>

I, who have so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes. Ah!

There was even a pane of framed plexiglass hanging on the wall, a work by a new artist whose prices were already cresting five figures.

<td>. A sterilizing cure is just what it sounds like: It “sterilizes” the body. This means that no trace of the virus can be found. A functional cure, on the other hand, doesn’t get rid of all traces of the pathogen. But a cure of either type means that the person does not require medication or therapy. Both types of cure mean a person doesn’t have to worry about the virus growing in his body or destroying her immune system. It is also highly unlikely that the person could infect anyone else.<br/>			 In people with a functional cure, lying hidden in their bodies, detectable only by the most sensitive tests, will be traces of the virus. Persons receiving this treatment are cured, but they will always carry a small piece of the virus with them. For most, it doesn’t matter if the cure they receive is sterilizing or functional; they simply want to be cured. Both Berlin patients received a functional cure for HIV, which is to say they both still carry the virus inside them and always will. This may sound like a strange cure, but it isn’t.

<td>The screaming metaphor might not do much to help. It can slide two ways. Humans scream when they’re distressed, shocked, excited, or in pain. Humans also scream in order to alert other humans to their plight. It’s not always easy to disentangle cause and effect, even if one asks the distressed human outright. With plants it’s even harder. Perhaps the fraught question of whether plants warn one another of an aphid attack or just happen to overhear their neighbor’s chemical shrieks is the wrong thing to ask. As Kiers remarked, “It’s the narrative that we tell that needs to be examined. I’d really love to get past the language and try to understand the phenomenon.” Once again, it may be more helpful to ask why this behavior has evolved in the first place: Who stands to benefit?</td>

What a stupid thing to do!<br/> I wait, frozen, for the woods to come alive with assailants. Then I remember there’s almost no one left.<br/>Peeta, who’s been wounded, is now my ally. Whatever doubts I’ve had about him dissipate because if either of us took the other’s life now we’d be pariahs when we returned to District 12. In fact, I know if I was watching I’d loathe any tribute who didn’t immediately ally with their district partner. Besides, it just makes sense to protect each other. And in my case — being one of the star-crossed lovers from District 12 — it’s an absolute requirement if I want any more help from sympathetic sponsors.<br/>The star-crossed lovers . . . Peeta must have been playing that angle all along. Why else would the Gamemakers have made this unprecedented change in the rules? For two tributes to have a shot at winning, our “romance” must be so popular with the audience that condemning it would jeopardize the success of the Games. No thanks to me. All I’ve done is managed not to kill Peeta. But whatever he’s done in the arena, he must have the audience convinced it was to keep me alive. Shaking his head to keep me from running to the Cornucopia. Fighting Cato to let me escape. Even hooking up with the Careers must have been a move to protect me. Peeta, it turns out, has never been a danger to me.<br/>The thought makes me smile. I drop my hands and hold my face up to the moonlight so the cameras can be sure to catch it.<br/></td>

<td>I’ve never really seen Boggs angry before. Not when I’ve disobeyed his orders or puked on him, not even when Gale broke his nose. But he’s angry when he returns from his phone call with the president. The first thing he does is instruct Soldier Jackson, his second in command, to set up a two-person, round-the-clock guard on Peeta. Then he takes me on a walk, weaving through the sprawling tent encampment until our squad is far behind us.<br/>“He’ll try and kill me anyway,” I say. “Especially here. Where there are so many bad memories to set him off.”<br/>“I’ll keep him contained, Katniss,” says Boggs.<br/>“Why does Coin want me dead now?” I ask.<br/>“She denies she does,” he answers.<br/>“But we know it’s true,” I say. “And you must at least have a theory.”<br/>Boggs gives me a long, hard look before he answers. “Here’s as much as I know. The president doesn’t like you. She never did. It was Peeta she wanted rescued from the arena, but no one else agreed. It made matters worse when you forced her to give the other victors immunity. But even that could be overlooked in view of how well you’ve performed.”<br/>“Then what is it?” I insist.<br/><br/>“Sometime in the near future, this war will be resolved. A new leader will be chosen,” says Boggs.<br/>I roll my eyes. “Boggs, no one thinks I’m going to be the leader.”<br/>“No. They don’t,” he agrees. “But you’ll throw support to someone. Would it be President Coin? Or someone else?”<br/>“I don’t know. I’ve never thought about it,” I say.<br/>“If your immediate answer isn’t Coin, then you’re a threat. You’re the face of the rebellion. You may have more influence than any other single person,” says Boggs. “Outwardly, the most you’ve ever done is tolerated her.”<br/>“So she’ll kill me to shut me up.” The minute I say the words, I know they’re true.<br/>“She doesn’t need you as a rallying point now. As she said, your primary objective, to unite the districts, has succeeded,” Boggs reminds me. “These current propos could be done without you. There’s only one last thing you could do to add fire to the rebellion.”<br/>“Die,” I say quietly.<br/>“Yes. Give us a martyr to fight for,” says Boggs. “But that’s not going to happen under my watch, Soldier Everdeen. I’m planning for you to have a long life.”<br/>“Why?” This kind of thinking will only bring him trouble. “You don’t owe me anything.”<br/>“Because you’ve earned it,” he says. “Now get back to your squad.”<br/>I know I should feel appreciative of Boggs sticking his neck out for me, but really I’m just frustrated. I mean, how can I steal his Holo and desert now? Betraying him was complicated enough without this whole new layer of debt. I already owe him for saving my life.</td>

<td>For most of its inhabitants, Hell is not that different from Earth; its principal punishment is the regret of not having loved God enough when alive, and for many that’s easily endured. For Neil, however, Hell bears no resemblance whatsoever to the mortal plane. His eternal body has well-formed legs, but he’s scarcely aware of them; his eyes have been restored, but he can’t bear to open them. Just as seeing Heaven’s light gave him an awareness of God’s presence in all things in the mortal plane, so it has made him aware of God’s absence in all things in Hell. Everything Neil sees, hears, or touches causes him distress, and unlike in the mortal plane this pain is not a form of God’s love, but a consequence of His absence. Neil is experiencing more anguish than was possible when he was alive, but his only response is to love God. Neil still loves Sarah, and misses her as much as he ever did, and the knowledge that he came so close to rejoining her only makes it worse. He knows his being sent to Hell was not a result of anything he did; he knows there was no reason for it, no higher purpose being served. None of this diminishes his love for God. If there were a possibility that he could be admitted to Heaven and his suffering would end, he would not hope for it; such desires no longer occur to him. Neil even knows that by being beyond God’s awareness, he is not loved by God in return. This doesn’t affect his feelings either, because unconditional love asks nothing, not even that it be returned.

Among the books that crossed his desk were research on fossils, medical texts, treatises on education, poetry, legal writing, sermons, periodicals, collections of personal letters, scientific explorations of color, books debunking common myths and superstitions of the day, abridged histories of the world, and other dictionaries.<br/> When he saw a word that piqued his interest, he underlined it, put the first letter of that word in the margin of the book, and then passed those heavily marked texts to his assistants, who would copy the passage down on a piece of paper. The pieces of paper were filed alphabetically; they were what Johnson referred to in writing his dictionary.<br/> Johnson’s system became the basis upon which nearly every dictionary from 1755 forward was prepared. Noah Webster used heavily annotated copies of books (and many, many other dictionaries) in preparing his 1828 American Dictionary of the English Language; every managing editor at what would be called the Oxford English Dictionary oversaw a public reading program to gather quotations and rare words from an international cadre of readers (including at least one murderous nutbar);*5 dictionary companies today still underline, bracket, and extract quotations, which we call “citations,” from a wide variety of sources.</td>

At the first talk I gave where I brought up spontaneous remission and what we, as doctors, might learn from it, I asked the audience of physicians how many of them had witnessed a story of recovery that made no sense from a medical perspective.

<td>By cross-referencing with other instances of erysipelas, Coley found more evidence of patients recovering unexpectedly from cancer after falling ill with a fever and infection after undergoing surgery to remove a cancerous tumor. He noticed that other medical pioneers such as Louis Pasteur had reported similar findings with erysipelas and began to suspect that postsurgical infections in some cases actually helped patients recover from cancer. Coley hypothesized that the infections triggered an immune response that not only ridded the body of the invading bacteria, as a fever is intended to do, but also stimulated the body’s immune system to attack the cancer cells.<br/> Coley immediately tested his theory on a cancer patient on whom all other treatments had failed, injecting him directly with live streptococcus bacteria. The man, who had a tumor the size of a chicken egg on his neck, could barely speak or swallow and had been given only weeks to live. After the injection, his fever flared and he grew alarmingly ill. But then, as he recovered from the infection, he and Coley watched the tumor dissolve and disappear. The man survived and went home cancer-free.<br/> The implications were astounding—somehow, the body’s natural processes of fighting infection were also breaking down cancerous tumors, liquefying and flushing them away as if they’d never been there.<br/> Rereading the story of Dr. Coley and Bessie Dashiell, I was struck by the visionary nature of his discoveries, so long ago. Coley, now called “the father of immunotherapy,” uncovered something essential about the power of the human immune system—a way to potentially turn it on to fight an incurable illness. He went on to develop a mixture of dead bacteria that he began to use as a cancer treatment, safer to use since this mixture was less likely to make sick people sicker to the point of death. But the idea of introducing “bad” bacteria into the body was difficult for people to accept.<br/></td>

<td>Semmelweis, without exactly knowing why, stumbled upon the solution: he had his medical students wash their hands in a chlorine/lime solution after performing autopsies and before delivering babies. The death rate from childbed fever immediately plummeted from a soaring high of close to 25 percent down to only 1 to 2 percent.<br/> It was a dramatic and undeniable success. But the medical world couldn’t, or wouldn’t, accept the theory that diseases were spread in this way. First of all, the notion that doctors carried some kind of infectious substance on their hands was laughed off as utter nonsense—to think there were tiny, invisible creatures covering surfaces and flying through the air spreading illness seemed absurd. And second, the idea that doctors had been responsible for their patients’ suffering and death all along was impossible to believe, anathema to the image of physicians as saviors. “Doctors are gentlemen,” said one prominent Philadelphia physician, “and a gentleman’s hands are clean.”<br/> Semmelweis was mocked and threatened and eventually run out of the medical profession entirely. He reportedly took to stopping pregnant women in the street and urging them to “make sure your doctor washes his hands.” Judged insane, he was committed to a psychiatric institution, where he died—quite possibly of the very same strain of sepsis that had once killed so many of his female patients.</td>

Each lizard has exactly eleven yellow spots, but the spots are hard to see on its yellow-green body.<br/><br/>     The lizard is from six to ten inches long and has big red eyes. In truth, its eyes are yellow, and it is the skin around the eyes which is red, but everyone always speaks of its red eyes. It also has black teeth and a milky white tongue.<br/><br/>     Looking at one, you would have thought that it should have been named a “red-eyed” lizard, or a “black-toothed” lizard, or perhaps a “white-tongued” lizard.<br/><br/>     If you’ve ever been close enough to see the yellow spots, you are probably dead.<br/><br/>     The yellow-spotted lizards like to live in holes, which offer shade from the sun and protection from predatory birds. Up to twenty lizards may live in one hole. They have strong, powerful legs, and can leap out of very deep holes to attack their prey. They eat small animals, insects, certain cactus thorns, and the shells of sunflower seeds.</td>

She has committed no crime, she has merely broken a rigid and time-honored code of our society, a code so severe that whoever breaks it is hounded from our midst as unfit to live with. She is the victim of cruel poverty and ignorance, but I cannot pity her: she is white. She knew full well the enormity of her offense, but because her desires were stronger than the code she was breaking, she persisted in breaking it. She persisted, as her subsequent reaction is something that all of us have known at one time or another. She did something every child has done—she tried to put the evidence of her offense away from her. But in this case she was no child hiding stolen contraband: she struck out at her victim—of necessity she must put him away from her—he must be removed from her presence, from this world. She must destroy the evidence of her offense.<br/><br/>   “What was the evidence of her offense? Tom Robinson, a human being. She must put Tom Robinson away from her. Tom Robinson was her daily reminder of what she did. What did she do? She tempted a Negro.<br/><br/>   “She was white, and she tempted a Negro. She did something that in our society is unspeakable: she kissed a black man. Not an old Uncle, but a strong young Negro man.

Atticus said he had a feeling, nothing more than a suspicion, that they left the jail that night with considerable respect for the Finches.

So much for finding out who’s going to win in the fifth race at Santa Anita on April 1, 2375.<br/> Still, Dr. Zeus played around with the field and discovered what could at first be taken as a comforting fact: History cannot be changed.

There is a locked door, you see, hinges red as blood with rust: it screams upon being opened and tries to close again, but through its narrow space I see the color green.<br/> Long grass where we lay, in the heart of the maze, and the little white flowers of the hedge had a sweet smell, like semen. I had filled my overskirt with damson plums, and we took turns eating them and reading to one another from De Immensa Misericordia Dei. I can still see the explosion of green at his window, the summer leaves crowding thick as though they would burst in on us where we sat naked on his bed. We had a dish of strawberries and a flagon of Rhenish wine, and he cradled a mandolin on his lap, for decency’s sake, he said; his big hands closed on the frets and plucked the strings. Sweat formed on his fair skin. He taught me songs.<br/><br/> This truly hurts. But I need to record that green filtered sunlight streaming in through the great hall, where we made eye contact over breakfast. His foot sought mine under the table. He peeled oranges for me in long curls of gold. I ate them for him in suggestive ways, eloquent with lips and tongue. God knows what the servants thought.<br/> So you may laugh at my heart’s nakedness, but I’ll tell you this much: all my nasty expectations fell away like stone birds that summer. With each sexual act and variation, layers of fear came away to reveal a commonplace, comfortable pastime.<br/> It wasn’t that the obsession died—Christ, we couldn’t keep our hands off each other. What clutchings in the maze, what passionate and explicit notes in Greek we left for each other! But it became innocent. Maybe wholesome is a better word. Pleasant and unremarkable as eating. No sense of sin.

<td>Much of the sensing done by these tiny organisms is aimed at finding food and avoiding toxins. Even in the earliest work on E. coli, though, it seemed that something else was going on. They were also attracted to chemicals they could not eat. Biologists who work on these organisms are more and more inclined to see the senses of bacteria as attuned to the presence and activities of other cells around them, not just to washes of edible and inedible chemicals. The receptors on the surfaces of bacterial cells are sensitive to many things, and these include chemicals that bacteria themselves tend to excrete for various reasons—sometimes just as overflow of metabolic processes. This may not sound like much, but it opens an important door. Once the same chemicals are being sensed and produced, there is the possibility of coordination between cells. We have reached the birth of social behavior.<br/> An example is quorum sensing. If a chemical is both produced and sensed by a particular kind of bacterium, it can be used by those bacteria to assess how many individuals of the same kind are around. By doing this, they can work out whether enough bacteria are nearby for it to be worthwhile to produce a chemical that does its job only if many cells make it at once.</td>

<td><br/> A bacterium is so small that its sensors alone can give it no indication of the direction that a good or bad chemical is coming from. To overcome this problem, the bacterium uses time to help it deal with space. The cell is not interested in how much of a chemical is present at any given moment, but rather in whether that concentration is increasing or decreasing. After all, if the cell swam in a straight line simply because the concentration of a desirable chemical was high, it might travel away from chemical nirvana, not toward it, depending on the direction it’s pointing. The bacterium solves this problem in an ingenious manner: as it senses its world, one mechanism registers what conditions are like right now, and another records how things were a few moments ago. The bacterium will swim in a straight line as long as the chemicals it senses seem better now than those it sensed a moment ago. If not, it’s preferable to change course.</td>

The rowers together can propel the boat forward, but even if they are vigorous, their individual actions will not get the boat to go anywhere unless they coordinate what they’re doing.

Both of these roles can be played at the same time and there’s no conflict between them. Getting a boat to move requires the coordination of micro-actions, but someone also needs to watch where the boat is going. The person calling the stroke, the coxswain or “cox,” usually acts as the crew’s eyes and as a coordinator of micro-actions. The same combination can be seen in a nervous system.</td>

<td>important. Through much of the twentieth century, a sensory-motor view of the evolution of nervous systems was simply assumed, and it took some time for the second view, the one based on internal coordination, to become clear. Chris Pantin, an English biologist, developed the second view in the 1950s and it has been revived recently by Fred Keijzer, a philosopher. They rightly point out that it’s easy to fall into the habit of thinking of each “action” as a single unit, in which case the only problem left to solve is coordinating these acts with the senses, working out when to do X rather than Y. As organisms get bigger and can do more, that picture becomes more and more inaccurate. It ignores the problem of how an organism is able to do X or Y in the first place. Pressing an alternative to the sensory-motor theory was a good thing. I’ll call this the action-shaping view of the role played by early nervous systems.<br/> Returning to the history</td>

<td>Yet it had been Cape who transformed the family fortunes with his apples. When he was eighteen, he began attending classes at the hortischool extension in Longwalk, very much against GiGo’s wishes. He had paid tuition out of money earned doing odd jobs around the village—another pointless diversion from home chores that irritated his parents. Cape had become interested in fruit trees after brown rot spoiled almost the entire crop of Littleton’s sour cherries the year before. All the farmers in the village raised fruit, but their orchards were usually no more than a dozen trees, all of traditional heirloom varieties. Crops were small, usually just enough for home use because of the ravages of pests and disease. Farmers battled Terran immigrants like tarnished plant bugs, sawflies, wooly aphids, coddling moths, leafrollers, lesser apple worms, and the arch enemy: plum curculio. There were mildews, rusts, rots, cankers, blotches and blights to contend with as well. The long growing season of fruit trees made them vulnerable to successive attacks. Citizens across the Transcendent State debated whether or not Chairman Winter had introduced insect evil and fungal disease into his new Garden of Eden on purpose. The question had never been settled. But at hortischool, Cape learned about neem spray, extracted from the chinaberry tree, and the organic insecticide pyrethrum, which was made from dried daisies. And he heard about an amazing cider apple called Huang’s Nectar, a disease-resistant early bloomer, well-suited to the climate of Southeast but not yet proven hardy in the north. As much to spite his father as to test the new variety, he had drained his savings and bought a dozen saplings on w4 semi-dwarfing rootstock. He started his own orchard on land he had cleared near his hut. Two years later, he brought in his first—admittedly light—harvest, which nevertheless yielded the sweetest cider and smoothest applejack anyone in Littleton had ever tasted. Cape purchased a handscrew press in his third year and switched from fermenting his cider in glass carboys to huge oak barrels by his fifth. And he bought more apple trees—he never seemed to have enough: McIntosh, GoRed, Jay’s Pippin, Alumar Gold, Adam and Eve. Soon he began to grow rootstock and sell trees to other farmers. By the time Cape married Spur’s mother, the Leungs were renting land from farmsteads on either side of their original holding.</td>

A dragon is simply a dragon—make yourself small when it dives down at you, but hold your ground and strike at the underbelly, and you’ve won the day. But a griffin, now…a griffin is two highly dissimilar creatures, eagle and lion, fused together by some god with a god’s sense of humor. And so there is an eagle’s heart beating in the beast, and a lion’s heart as well, and you must pierce them both to have any hope of surviving the battle.” He was as cheerful as he could be about it all, holding me safe on the saddle, and saying over and over, the way old people do, “Two hearts, never forget that—many people do.

He turned in a complete circle, all senses heightened, trying to pinpoint the source. After fire ran through the litter of leaves and twigs that covered the forest floor, it often sank into the duff, the layer of decomposing organic matter that lay just above the soil level. Since duff was like a sponge, most of the year it was too wet to burn. But in the heat of summer it could dry out and became tinder. Spur had seen a smoldering fire burrow through the layer of duff and emerge dozens of meters away. He sniffed, following his nose to a charred stump. “Prosper!” said Ngonda. “What are you doing?” Spur heard a soft hiss as he crouched beside the stump. It wasn’t any fire sound that he knew, but he instinctively ran his bare hand across the stump, feeling for hotspots. Something cool and wet sprayed onto his fingers and he jerked them back as if he had been burned. He rubbed a smutty liquid between thumb and forefinger and then smelled it. It had an evil, manmade odor of extinguished fire. Spur sat back on his heels, puzzled. Why would anyone want to mimic that particular stink? Then he realized that his hand was clean when it ought to have been smudged with soot from the stump. He rubbed hard against the burned wood, but the black refused to come off. He could see now that the stump had a clear finish, as if it had been coated with a preservative. Spur could sense Ngonda’s shadow loom over him but then he heard the hissing again and was able to pick out the tiny nozzle embedded in</td>

Those present represented a significant fraction of the working SF/fantasy fields at the time, arguably the cream of the stfnal (scientifictional) crop: the three principals, of course, and Katherine McLean, Algis Budrys, Arthur Clarke, Anthony Boucher, Cyril Kornbluth, Theodore Sturgeon, Fritz Leiber, Lester and Evelyn del Rey, Robert Silverberg, and Harlan Ellison all attending in the early days, exchanging ideas and criticizing each other’s work. Kate Wilhelm, not yet then married to Knight, describes it as being “a meeting of peers, no chiefs [or] Indians, just writers critiquing one another’s stories. It never changed that format. Critiques early in the day, dinner, then discussions on set topics in the late hours.” In fact, it’s not too much of a stretch to say that, whereas the process of elevating SF (aka the “New Wave”) to a supposed level of capital-L </td>

<td>For purposes of the experiment, these waves describe the probability of a particle being found at any given location between the electron gun and the screen. Until a particle is detected by some<br/>  consciousness at a specific point along the wave, its location remains theoretical. Therefore, until a particle is observed passing through one slit, it could be equally anticipated to pass through<br/>  either – and thus will actually propagate through both in the form of probability waves. These wave systems interfere with each other at regular intervals and thereby assemble a visible<br/>  interference pattern on the capture screen behind the slits. But if a particle is detected by an observer at one slit, then that excludes the possibility of it passing through the other; and if it<br/>  can’t propagate through both, it can’t compile an interference pattern.<br/><br/>   This would seem self-contradictory, except for one thing. Except that the interference pattern disappears if someone is watching.</td>

<td>Once kea have learned how to solve a problem or use a gadget, they don’t forget. Schwing brings out a wooden box he used in an elaborate experiment some years earlier to test the kea’s cognitive skills and ability to cooperate. The wooden box is raised on legs and bottomed by a tray that drops down if properly triggered. In the experiment, the tray was loaded with treats—parrot pellets stuck there with cream cheese. Attached to the tray were four separate chains threaded through holes in the side of the box. To release the tray and access the treats, four kea had to pull the different chains simultaneously—and continue to pull together until the tray released. If only one bird pulled at a time, the chain would slide out without moving the tray. If any of the birds lets go too soon, the tray would pop back up out of reach.<br/>			 The results were impressive. Kermit led the way, and after a little training, the other kea quickly learned to pull together—and to persist—so they could all get their treats.<br/>			 A couple of years later, a film and photography crew from the National Geographic Society wanted to take photos of the kea cooperatively solving the wooden box and strings puzzle. “I didn’t have high hopes,” Schwing recalls. The kea hadn’t seen the puzzle box in over a year. But he took what he thought were his four best birds and put them in a waiting compartment while the crews set up the cameras.<br/>			 “It was breeding season, so there was some tension—they were chasing each other around in there,” he says. “And I thought, ‘Oh, this is not looking good.’ But the moment I opened the gate for them to get access to the box, they fell in line, one after another, not even a body length in distance between beak and tail. And in this group of four they walked right over to the box, past the photographers, past the lights, past everything, walked right up and found their places and pulled on the chains.<br/>			 “We did this several times so the camera crew could get all their shots. The photographer ended up lying down with his head so close to one kea that he was blocking access to the chain. The bird walked over and just pushed the photographer’s head aside with his foot so he could get to the chain and pull on it.</td>

<td>The revelation illuminated the complexity and diversity of mating systems in birds and put to rest the romantic notion of devoted and monogamous avian mates—to the point where exclusive monogamy in a bird pair is actually considered noteworthy. Among the handful of true monogamists are mute swans, black vultures, scarlet macaws, bald eagles, Laysan’s albatrosses, whooping cranes, California condors, and Atlantic puffins. At the other end of the spectrum are the champions of extra-pair sex, Australian magpies and fairy-wrens. The mismatch between the fairy-wrens’ social mating system—the birds form lifelong pair-bonds—and their sexual mating system is nothing short of spectacular. Studies have shown that up to two-thirds of offspring in fairy-wren nests are sired by extra-pair males—the highest known incidence of cuckoldry in birds.</td>

<td>When Toshitaka Suzuki, a researcher at Kyoto University, discovered this, it inspired him to explore whether this sort of specific alarm call might actually cause the listening bird to summon a specific image in its brain, in this case, of a snake. In human speech, words referring to a specific object usually evoke a visual mental image. Think moon or dog or snake. Suzuki found evidence that Japanese tit alarm calls create just this kind of search image in the heads of listening birds. The tit’s jar call causes the birds to search for snakes and to become more visually responsive to any object resembling a snake. It was the first evidence that a non-human animal could visualize something referred to in a vocalization.</td>

<td>	 If a cuckoo parasitizes a host species, the host will evolve the ability to reject the foreign eggs. This was the accepted wisdom when Naomi Langmore of Australian National University started working on cuckoos in Australia in the early 2000s. But the more field studies she looked at, the more evidence she found against this. In fact, most Australian host species tended not to reject cuckoo eggs. “Which is completely counter to evolutionary theory,” she says. “The arms race between them should exert powerful pressure on the host both to recognize foreign eggs and to reject them.”<br/>			 Were the host birds down under really incapable of distinguishing between their own eggs and a cuckoo’s?<br/>			 To find out, Langmore made a slew of little plastic eggs that were bright blue—different from the egg color of any host species in Australia—and placed them in the nests of a lot of different host species. She found that host birds that built cup-shaped nests could easily recognize and reject those plastic eggs. But birds that built dome-shaped nests, such as fairy-wrens, could not. This makes sense: Dome nests are dark places where it’s tough to make visual distinctions.<br/>			 Then Langmore made the sort of discovery that shocks scientists and makes research on this weird system of parenting so rewarding. When she looked more closely at birds that build these dome nests, primarily fairy-wrens and thornbills, she found to her amazement that although they couldn’t reject cuckoo eggs, they had a very fine ability to recognize cuckoo chicks—and reject them. The little host birds would either seize the intruding chick and drag it out of the nest or abandon the nest altogether to start a new breeding attempt.</td>

If a young mimic male is successful, “thereafter, he would likely be treated by the other birds in the lek as if he were actually Fred, their local neighbor, and tolerated as the rightful owner of his territory,” he says. “The other territory holders wouldn’t know the difference because his mimicry is sufficiently well practiced to fool them.”</td>

Play is a strange behavior in any animal, says Osvath. “There are so many good reasons not to do it.” It takes a lot of energy that could be used for other purposes—growing, for instance. It’s also inherently risky. “If you’re out in the wild, and everyone is playing, then no one is paying attention to any potential threat. A bird at play is particularly conspicuous to predators, which are never far away.” The behavior seems at best extravagant; at worst, downright dangerous. “Out in the wild, playing must be very important,” says Osvath. “Otherwise, why would you make yourself vulnerable in this way? It’s a world of eagles, owls, even wolves out there. Distraction at the wrong moment could mean the end of you.”<br/>			 Why would a raven play? What possible benefits could there be to larking about? Do these birds play because they’re intelligent, or are they intelligent because they play?</td>

Suzuki created a call that these birds had never heard before—an artificial sequence that combined their own ABC alert call with the tää recruitment call of another species, a willow tit. When he played the combination calls, the Japanese tits decoded the meaning of the ABC-tää combination, but not when it was played in reverse. This suggests that the birds are not just memorizing complex signals but rather applying a generalized grammatical ordering rule to decode messages.</td>

Predators are a big problem for these birds. During their first winter of life, more than a third are taken by owls, pine martens, sparrowhawks, and especially goshawks, which account for 70 percent of all kills. Goshawks hunt in three phases—perching in a tree and scanning for prey, making search flights to the next perch, where they scan some more, and then, finally, bulleting through the brush to take their prey by surprise. The jays have evolved a sophisticated system of three different alarm calls specifying the hunting phase of the hawk—whether it’s perched, searching for prey, or attacking.<br/></td>

He sat down next to the aviary for the ravens, birds he had hand-raised himself or worked with closely, so they knew him well. They expected good things from him and came over to see what he was doing. He pulled out his bike light, and the instant he turned it on, the birds fled. Then he went over to the kea aviary. The kea saw him walk by their aviary every day, so he was familiar, and when he sat down, they ignored him. Until he turned on the light. He was instantly cluttered with a chaos of kea.<br/>			 This dichotomy affects how the different labs at Haidlhof train students to work with the two birds, says Schwing. With the ravens, students are asked to stand outside the aviary for something like two to three weeks to give the ravens a chance to get to know them before they’re allowed to interact with the birds in any way. “With kea, we do the opposite,” says Schwing: “We train our students by sending them into the aviary with the caretakers to help with the cleaning, so the kea get to know them in a routine setting. Because once we start testing, we don’t want the students to be so novel and interesting to the kea that they ignore what they’re supposed to be doing and just go play with this new person they’ve never seen before,” he says.<br/></td>

<td>One lyrebird in Dalziell’s study area wins a lot of matings. She calls him Triple Blue and he sings especially beautifully, “a truly astounding free-flowing improvisation full of loud, flamboyant mimicry,” she says. “For lyrebirds, the evidence is strong that mimicry in males is sexually selected.” Belting out mimicry to females he can’t see is a male’s way of advertising himself, saying, “Look how clever I am, how accurate and versatile my mimicry is, how strong is my voice. I’m very intelligent (the accuracy of my mimicry shows that I have a good brain), and I can sing for hours a day.” As Dalziell points out, the female alone sees to all the parental care—building the nest, brooding and raising the chick, defending her feeding territory. All she needs from a male is sperm. A choosy female measures a prospective mate by his spectacular plumage, his dancing ability, and his loud, complex, flamboyant song, including the versatility and accuracy of his mimicry and the carrying capacity of his calls. All of these traits may act as “honest” signals of a male’s quality—his ability to learn, his strength and vigor, his genes, the conditions in which he was raised. “It’s probably good for females to mate with males that are proficient vocal mimics so that their offspring are also competent at using mimicry to defend nests if they’re female and to obtain mates if they’re male,” says Dalziell. A female will listen to various males for months and months before she settles on a mate. Only the best performers get to pass on their genes. Hence, a smart, high-performing bird species gets smarter, better at mimicking, at dancing, and at growing gorgeous tail feathers.</td>

The first day the fledglings arrive in the group, they’re overwhelmed with food. They start beating their wings to get rid of the adults because they just can’t swallow any more food.”</td>

<td>Birds top us in color vision, too. They see hues beyond our imagining. Humans have three types of color-receptive cones in our retinas, blue, green, and red. Birds have a fourth color cone that is sensitive to ultraviolet wavelengths. We are thus “trichromatic,” and most diurnal birds are “tetrachromatic.” With their extra UV cone, birds can distinguish shades of color we can’t tell apart, allowing them to spot prey well camouflaged against the uniform background of a grassy field or leafy forest floor, and to detect things invisible to us—like the trail of urine left by a vole.<br/>			 But it goes beyond this. Birds see a massive spectrum of color our brains are simply incapable of processing. “It’s not just that they can see wavelengths of colors in a part of the spectrum we can’t see,” says Mary Caswell Stoddard, an assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Princeton University, who studies avian color vision. “It’s that ultraviolet light is a fundamental part of many of the colors they perceive. They’re experiencing another whole dimension of color—all the colors we can see, with varied amounts of UV mixed in. So it’s not simply human vision plus some purplish UV colors. It’s a complete reimagining of the color experience.”<br/>			 While there’s no way to know what a color actually looks like to birds, Stoddard can measure with a spectrophotometer the wavelengths of light reflected by an object or a surface. This tells her whether or not a color is reflecting ultraviolet light. Then she can estimate its appearance in a way that’s relevant to bird vision using a computer program called TetraColorSpace that she developed with ornithologist</td>

Osvath and a graduate student, Can Kabadayi, taught five ravens how to use a special tool—a stone of a specific weight and shape—to open a puzzle-like box containing a high-value treat. Though ravens are not tool users by nature, the birds were quick studies, requiring only one lesson to learn the trick—“a single observation of tool use by a non-tool-using species!” Osvath exclaims. When the experimenters took the box away and presented the ravens with a choice of objects, only one of which was the functional tool that could open the box, the birds picked the object that would be most useful to them if that treat-laden puzzle box reappeared in the future. They could wait as long as seventeen hours and would do so even when they were offered an inferior treat immediately; despite the temptation, the birds didn’t bite on the lesser alternative. Instead, they chose the special tool and saved it to secure the later, tastier reward.<br/></td>

We humans have existed as a species for at most a few hundred thousand years—in geological terms, a flash in the pan, statistically insignificant. But in the short time of our existence, crows, ravens, and other corvids have learned to use us as a source of food and shelter. If our species disappears and corvids lose this resource, there may be selective pressure among them to boost cognition, says Osvath.

Cooler temperatures, calmer air, less ambient noise from insects (and traffic), allow a bird’s song to travel farther, the better to stake its territory—at least in northern species—or to broadcast its presence to prospective mates. Or maybe it’s that predators are less of a threat.

<td>Here’s where duetting comes in. The temperate regions such as North America and Europe, where duetting is rare, and female song in general is less common, are the regions that host a lot of migrants. “It’s the migratory birds that have lost female song,” explains Langmore, who was part of the study. “Migrants have a very different pattern of territoriality and pairing than in the tropics. Typically, the male will arrive on the breeding grounds singing his head off, and the females will fly in and listen, and they’ll plunk down on the chosen male’s territory. Then they’ll have a very short breeding season. They just go for it like crazy, and then they leave.”<br/>			 Resident birds, on the other hand, like those in the tropics, have to defend their territory all year long. If, over the years, a partner dies, the remaining bird has to be able to defend that territory and attract a new mate. “And there can be divorce, as well,” says Langmore. “Whichever bird is left has to be able to sing to defend its territory or attract a new mate. So it seems like it’s quite a recent thing that females have lost song in these migratory groups.”</td>

Visual play signals are common in animals—play faces of primates, play bowing in dogs and Australian babblers. But play sounds are rarer, observed only in rats, squirrel monkeys, chimps, and cotton-top tamarins. To explore the kea calls in the wild as part of his PhD studies, Schwing set up speakers and video recorders at Deaths Corner lookout one cold and dreary winter. He deliberately chose the worst season for the study and went out in the worst weather, gloomy, cold, and drizzly, when no bird in its right mind would be in the mood to frolic. Through the speakers, he played five recorded sounds for five minutes apiece, the warbling play call; two other kea calls; a call of a common bird in the area, the South Island robin; and a simple standardized tone.<br/>			 The little videos of the results are a hoot. Two adult kea just hanging around on a stone wall, minding their own business in the misty drizzle. The recording of the warbling play call is heard in the background, and suddenly the birds look at each other, burst into squeals, and launch into play, becoming exceedingly silly, chasing each other, flapping up and down, picking up rocks and flinging them, playing hard for the full five minutes of the recording.<br/>			 “With the warble calls, play just went</td>

So the quelea form little neighborhoods surrounded by familiar birds, individuals they know will stick to their own nest and not try to steal from them. A newly arrived, unfamiliar male poses a bigger threat than a familiar neighbor going about his own nest building. It’s called the “dear enemy effect.” The birds get to know their neighbors very quickly. One quelea signals its identity to another by flashing its face, making it easy for the neighbor to quickly learn who it is. “Once that’s settled,” says Dale, “everyone can stop harassing each another and get down to the business of nest building.”</td>

For two years he recorded their vocalizations and then grouped them into seven categories, ranging from that screeching piercing “hello” contact call, which carries well over long distances and in windy conditions, to a soft whistle, barely audible but with almost magical effects on the listener (Schwing dubs it the “cuddle call”). Some of the kea at Messerli use the whistle call with Schwing, but in the wild, it’s extremely rare. Out of nearly twenty-five thousand calls he recorded, only twenty-four were this whistle. Schwing believes it’s a very personal communication between one bird and another that seems to say, “I want to have close contact.” A video he took of the whistle call shows a male perched on a bench. A female lands and moves toward him to preen him, but he kicks her away. She jumps back and then whistles quietly. He immediately lowers his head and allows her to come in and preen him. “We have birds in the aviary who can be quite rambunctious and bite hard,” says Schwing, “but when another bird gives the whistle, they become very gentle.” Schwing suspects these vocalizations are actually externalizations of the birds’ internal emotional state.</td>

This crow makes and keeps its own highly sophisticated tools. It’s the only species other than humans to make and use hook tools, little sticks with a hook on the end, which the bird uses to extract grubs and other invertebrates from tree holes and the nooks and crannies of plants. The crows also make very elaborate hooked tools from the leaves of pandanus trees. Pandanus leaves have little barbs along the edge, which the bird uses to latch onto its grubs. It takes a lot of complicated steps to make these tools. The birds make several methodical cuts and tears in the leaf before removing the fully crafted tool from the leaf. This suggests they have an image of the tool in their heads before they actually start making it.<br/>			 In 2018, the New Caledonian crow showed us that a bird can create tools by combining two or more elements—a feat so far seen only in humans and great apes. For the experiment, researchers caught eight crows in the wild of New Caledonia and brought them to a research station at Oxford University. They presented the crows with a puzzle box the birds had never seen before, which held a small food container behind a door with a narrow open slot along the bottom. They gave the crows long sticks, which the birds promptly inserted through the slot and used to push the food out through a window in the side of the box. Then the scientists gave the crows stick pieces too short to reach the food—some hollow and some solid, with different diameters so that they could fit inside one another.<br/>			 With no training or guidance, four of the crows put together the pieces within five minutes and used the longer compound pole to reach and extract the food.

The engineers had figured out that if they introduced ethyl mercaptan into the line, they could locate leaks by the concentrations of turkey vultures circling above the line or sitting on the ground next to it. The same sulfurous chemical added to natural gas so the human nose can detect a leak, it turns out, is also released by an animal shortly after it dies.

Another house wren filled a birdhouse with nesting material but then could not find a mate, so he fed three black-headed grosbeaks with caterpillars and other foods until they fledged. As if that wasn’t enough, he then fed a family of nestling house sparrows. When a brood of eastern kingbirds were orphaned after an electrical storm, an eastern wood pewee fed the foundlings for ten days until they fledged. Likewise, a pair of starlings that lost their nest numerous times to a flood of rainwater in the drain spout they had chosen as their nesting site finally gave up their own breeding efforts and tended to some nestling American robins.</td>

<td>Budgies and other birds learn their songs and calls through a process very similar to the way we learn to speak. It’s a process of imitating and practicing called vocal learning, and it’s extremely rare in the animal world. Vocal learning in birds begins early, just as it does in humans. By the last trimester of pregnancy, a human fetus can memorize what it hears from the external world and is especially sensitive to melody in both music and language. This appears to be true for some birds, too. The embryos of certain species can hear through the shell of the egg; in response to the voice of a parent, their heart rate increases. As a defense against brood parasites, superb fairy-wrens learn special vocal passwords from their parents when they’re still in the egg. Scientists have found that at least five days before they hatch, the unborn fairy-wren chicks learn to imitate the call. Zebra finch parents can tell their young while they’re still developing in the egg that it’s hot outside. This is vital information for a growing chick. In hot climates, birds need to be able to lose heat, which is easier with a smaller body. When zebra finch parents are breeding in a hot climate, and the nest hits a temperature above 80 degrees Fahrenheit, they’ll chirp the news to their unborn chicks in the last third of the incubation period—the moment when the embryos are developing their temperature-regulation system. In response to these “hot calls,” the chicks will actually curtail their growth and emerge smaller—an adaptive advantage in the heat.<br/></td>

<td>If it exists, fire-spreading may be evidence of highly sophisticated cognition in these raptors—a grasp of a two-step sequence of cause and effect: first, that dropping smoldering sticks will set a field afire, and second, that the resulting fire started in a new spot will drive out prey. Moreover, if kites and falcons have learned to manipulate fire to flush out prey, this would be the first known use of fire as a tool by any nonhuman animal, overturning some old entrenched assumptions—the orthodoxy that only humans spread fire, and that our singular mastery of fire was largely what made us masters over the environment. But it could have worked the other way around, says Bonta. “It could very well have been the case that humans, birds, and fire coevolved in some sort of mutualistic relationship—perhaps humans actually derived the idea of using fire from watching birds.

<td>In fact, play is most often defined by what it is not: It is behavior that is not purposeful, serves no obvious adaptive function, does nothing to enhance an animal’s chance of survival and reproduction—nothing apparent, at least.<br/>			 Not long ago, Gordon Burghardt, an evolutionary psychologist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, took on the problem of crafting a more positive definition of play and came up with a set of five criteria for recognizing play in any species. First, it’s behavior that’s not fully functional, although it may resemble behavior that’s useful in another context. For instance, a puppy thrashing a toy mimics a wolf’s takedown of prey, but the puppy doesn’t end up eating the toy (well, not usually, although my pitbull-lab mix has been known to). Play is exaggerated, awkward, and repetitive—like all those excessive flourishes in flight of the ravens on Santa Cruz Island—and often inappropriate. It’s also spontaneous, voluntary, intentional, pleasurable, and rewarding. It’s only initiated when an animal is adequately fed, healthy, and not under stress. In sum, says Burghardt, “Play is repeated, seemingly non-functional behavior different from more adaptive versions . . . and initiated when the animal is in a relaxed, unstimulating or low stress setting.” In other words, it’s a kind of behavioral frill—but far from a frivolous one.</td>

What Meir and York learned through their experiments was that the geese have yet another superbird mechanism: a unique response to temperature.

One captive raven was observed tossing a rubber ball in the air again and again and catching it while lying on its back. A tipster in Arthur Cleveland Bent’s Life Histories of North American Jays, Crows, and Titmice watched ravens sliding down the high bank of a river on rolling pebbles and crumbling clay, a dozen at a time, croaking loudly with apparent enjoyment. “This noise was heard over a mile before we paddled up to the birds, where we stopped to witness their amusement. The trees in the vicinity contained numbers of ravens aiding the sport with their cries of approval or taking their turns as the others became tired.”<br/></td>

A person can maintain control over his or her life and have a heart attack in the process, due to the anxiety and stress that accompany the effort to control the events of the outside world.<br/> “Holding dominion over” refers to our capacity to maintain the controlling influence in terms of the flow of our own lives, even if the flow includes compromise or altering our plans. Holding dominion does not mean always getting one’s own way. It means being able to participate in the natural give and take of life, to be flexible, to respond to the needs of others and to reach for what you need from a position of inner strength and confidence. It means being able to have an effective voice in making your own choices.<br/> Every person</td>

I am suitably impressed with you tonight, Miss Ettings.”<br/>       Dora blinked at that. Somewhere distant, the words gently nudged themselves against a pile of misery, knocking away a few of the other ugly words that had nested there.</td>

But he seems truly chastened tonight, and now in a more generous and contrite state of being than ever before. If you continue to perform such miracles, you may yet be in danger of being canonised.”<br/>       Dora looked down at the green slippers on her feet. “I will ask the priest on Sunday,” she said absently. “But I suspect I must be dead before I may be canonised, Lady Carroway.

She could not help but be aware of his arm sliding around her back, as they continued to prepare for the dance. “Is there some other help that I might offer, in that case? I cannot imagine you came to one of these parties you so hate in order to dance.”<br/>       Elias had not looked away from her once as they talked. Tired as he was, there was no hint in him of the desperate anger she had seen only a day prior. There was still grief, Dora thought, but it was tempered with something softer and less violent. “You are correct, of course,” Elias told her. “I despise these silly balls. I did not come here simply to dance.” He cleared his throat slightly. “I have again had little success today. I found myself sitting alone in the dark, tired and bitter. And I suppose I could have stayed like that. But I promised Albert that I would be kinder to myself. And so I tried to think of where I would want to be, if I were not so bound to this hopeless task.”<br/>       Dora knitted her brow. “You cannot have thought of Lady Cushing’s ball,” she said sceptically.<br/>       “I did not,” Elias said. “I thought of you, Dora.

She was embarrassed to realise that indeed, nearly half of her interactions with strangers had been about the weather after all. Thankfully, she had many other interactions to call upon. “If one were to breed a dolphin with a horse,” Dora said ponderously, “would the resulting creature have a dolphin’s head and a horse’s end, or would it be the other way around?”<br/>       “Oh!” Lord Blackthorn said. “Well clearly, the creature would have a dolphin’s head.

<td>A knock at the door interrupted that train of thought. Lady Carroway headed in looking very flustered, holding a vase of fresh white roses in her arms. There was something distinctly different about these flowers, however—and after a moment of looking at them, Dora realised that they sometimes looked more like mist than like roses. Those are from Hollowvale’s gardens, she thought.<br/>       “These are for you, Miss Ettings,” Lady Carroway told Dora. “I think they are to entice you downstairs.” She settled the flowers onto the dresser and shook her head with a smile. “The Lord Sorcier would like a private audience with you. We all know he is not here to ask about French translations. Should I have him wait downstairs while you dress, or turn him away in order to save his pride?”<br/>       Vanessa caught the implication in a moment, having just finished her own private audience with Edward only a few days prior.

<td>You should say whatever you like,” Dora told him. “I am happy to see you. Surely, you know that the rest does not matter.”<br/>       Elias knitted his brow. “I do feel that it matters,” he said, and there was suddenly a note of contrariness to his voice. “One does not simply say let us go and get married, if you are amenable.”<br/>       “But you did say that.” Dora beamed gently at him. “And I was amenable. I still am.”<br/>       “Would you not argue with me for once?” Elias said with a flush. “Listen here, Miss Ettings! I am in love with you. You deserve to hear that. I love your wit and cleverness. I love that you are kind but almost never nice. I love your eyes and your hair and your freckles, and the fact that you smell like some monstrous floral perfume all of the time.” He paused, now looking somewhat offended at himself. “And I love to dance with you. That is the worst of it by far.”<br/>       Dora blinked slowly. Each word heated up her heart bit by bit until it was a bewildering bonfire. That fire burned its way down into her mind, consuming all of the ugly things that still lingered beneath its surface. When she was alone or tired or uncertain, Dora knew that these would be the words that came to her now instead of all those others, and she could not help but smile in a silly, dreamy way.<br/>       “And obviously,” Elias said with a huff, “I would like to marry you.

<td>Dora had the distinct pleasure of attending her cousin’s wedding brunch with her fiancée on her arm. It was everything that a proper wedding brunch ought to be—and more besides. Elias had been in an unusually pleasant mood for weeks by then, and he was feeling so whimsical that he made the swan-folded napkins get up and flutter around for everyone’s entertainment. Vanessa’s resulting smile was nearly a magic spell all on its own.<br/>       Dora’s own wedding was small, but Lady Carroway insisted on hosting a brunch at Carroway House for her as well. Albert’s mother had not forgotten her plans to open another orphanage, and much of the morning’s conversation ended up scandalously centred around those plans, rather than around the weather or the wedding. Dora thought it was the perfect sort of brunch.<br/>       Life after marriage was much different than Dora might ever have imagined. In fact, it was much better in nearly every possible way—but she suspected that had much to do with her choice of husband. As a married woman, she was far more free to spend her time as she pleased; and since she was of a mind with Elias on most things, he was only too happy to let her roll up her sleeves to help both Mrs Dun and the new orphanage. Most women of the nobility had only a few children, Dora liked to say—but she had very many, and she loved them all the same. And though it was rare for Dora to feel any sense of breathless joy, she carried with her always a soft, contented glow, rather like the star upon her finger.<br/>       The ton soon began to murmur that married life quite agreed with the Lord Sorcier; for while Elias would never be well-mannered, he was certainly distinctly happier. There were times, of course, when dark things threatened and great evils endangered his rest—but if he sometimes came home to sit awake in the dark, Dora always insisted at least on being with him.<br/></td>

The rabbit who always won, who might drive the mean-spirited duck or the little pink man crazy with his tricks but who was never mean-spirited himself. That had been my favorite role for years and years, clever immortal guy outwitting brutish mortals but never doing them any harm.<br/> Gradually the world got darker and smaller, and my job got a little dirtier. So I told myself I was the man who had to go down the mean streets, though he wasn’t mean himelf. I was still the hero, even if now and then I had to hurt somebody. And if it was kind of lonely sometimes, well, that went with the job. Philip Marlowe never got the girl, did he? He always seemed to end up alone in his rented room, no company but a bottle or a chess problem, until the door should open and another desperate soul ask for his help.<br/> You really have to lie to yourself sometimes, if you’re stuck with eternal life.<br/> But there would come a point where it was just no use anymore, not with the things I had to do in my line of work, and I couldn’t seem to find the role. I was the secret good guy on the bad-guy team, right, playing the Company’s hand, not really a member of the Inquisition. But for every Jew I smuggled out of the dungeons because his genetic code was unique and the Company wanted it passed on, I had to watch as twenty were burned. Hell, I helped burn them. Being able to play the sinister Spanish devil, a good meaty part, wasn’t much compensation.<br/> I’d been playing Coyote for years now, really, hadn’t I? No hero at all, and lately not even much of a villain. God knows I did what the Company asked of me—what else could I do?—but nowadays most of my jobs seemed to consist of catching anvils with my head. How far down was I going to fall?

She did a lot of wistful talking over her nonalcoholic Chardonnay; so did her money. One thing led to another, and within two weeks the New Life Chumash Nation had placed its order with the Company. As the Company had known it would.<br/> Bring the Chumash out of the past for us, they said. Give us back our traditions, our ancient ways. We want to dress up in Chumash robes. We want the total Chumash experience. Spare no expense.<br/> And with those magic words, Dr. Zeus got to work. From their labs they got out all this Chumash genetic material that they, uh, just happened to have. They brought out all the carefully propagated flora and fauna of the Chumash ecosystem from their botanical and zoological gardens. They brought from their records every possible detail of Chumash folkways and culture, and boy, they sure had a lot of material.<br/> The sacred ground was detoxified and bulldozed back into its original contours; it was replanted; it was restocked with animal life. Cleaning and restocking the adjacent ocean floor was harder, but, you know, they’d said to spare no expense, and who was the Company to argue? There was some outcry from historical preservationists when the picturesque old oil rigs off the coast were dismantled. Cash donations shut them up. When everything had naturalized, Humashup was rebuilt down to the last woven hut, and the New Life Chumash Nation moved in.<br/> The next step was making more Chumash. </td>

The Captain circled the globe, was indestructible, and was able to feed a constant false location for the Captain Morgan to the global surveillance satellites.<br/>He was now several hundred times more powerful than any artificial intelligence had ever been.

Its economy was just beginning to recover from a catastrophic hurricane five years earlier, and a general election was about to be held. Alec surveyed all the data from weather forecasts, estimated its probable national revenue for the next five years, factored in the personal histories of all candidates running for office, and decided which man was best for the country. He transferred three million pounds into that candidate’s election fund. Then he did a projection based on all known factors and prevailing trends, and nodded in satisfaction.

It takes thousands of them to create an archive of human wisdom; only one to set a torch to it.

He went on: “It should have been Fallon, but he passed away, poor creature. Pity. Still, we learned a lot from him; and dear Maeve is wonderfully vigorous. We have great hopes of her. Now, you needn’t be nervous! She may look like a child, but I can personally attest that you won’t have to teach her a thing.” He grinned broadly and Lord Victor stared down at the floor.<br/>I had a gulp of wine and nerved myself to ask him, “But—if she’s your favorite, divine Lord—won’t you mind?”<br/>“Mind? Good heavens, no. She’s a charming girl, but she is a mortal, as you are. She certainly can’t bear me children. I’ll admit I’ll miss our golden afternoons, but the plain fact is, she ought to be bred while she’s in her prime.” He said the last leaning forward, holding my gaze in a matter-of-fact way.<br/>I said, “I didn’t think she was mortal, exactly,” and he</td>

<td>So in the morning I couldn’t rise early enough, and the lawns had never been so perfectly in trim, and Maeve’s own exquisite garden took form and all the immortal lords and ladies came out of the mountain to wonder at it. They took me aside and told me how proud of me they were. They told me I was going to far surpass old Claude. They gave me commissions for designs, pot gardens for their private suites. I devised a way to build a running stream and ferny grotto in a sitting room for the lord Marcus. I devised an arbor of roses black as ink, approached along a walk framed by black irises and black velvet pansies, for the lady Ereshkigal. I devised an apple with the savor of Black Elysium liqueur for the lord Nathan. Immortals have eclectic tastes. But I had their respect, and that was a great consolation to me.</td>

<td>But I finished her garden.<br/>It far surpassed my topiary walk. The lord and ladies said so. How clever of me to make a moon-garden, all white and scented flowers and silvery herbage, best enjoyed under the stars! The scale was a little inconvenient for the immortals, as all the stone seats were set low and the stair risers, too; but the neophyte classes, the children being transformed into immortals, found the place and made it their own. They played there in the long summer evenings. The dark trees echoed back their laughter</td>

<td>But I’m having a, what would you mortals call it? A crisis of faith, perhaps. Not a good thing, when one has a career to consider. I’d really rather not question my beliefs, but the longer I stay here in the midst of all this”—he waved a hand at the pleasure gardens all around us—“the harder it becomes. I think I need to go down into the mortal places and watch real cruelty, real stupidity, real vanity. Perhaps then I can look at Aegeus with some sense of perspective. Or at least learn to appreciate his point of view …”<br/>His gaze drifted back to me. He sighed, supposing maybe that I had no idea what he was talking about. He said, “Do you know the myth of Jesus, Master Simeon?”<br/>I told him, of course I did. We are all taught about the dark superstitions that the mortals slave under, down there in their villages. Lord Victor said, “Do you suppose the Christ left Heaven for Earth to save mortal souls? Or is it possible he left because God’s behavior disgusted him?</td>

<td>Wamba was given new rooms and all the finery he could wear, and as a further favor he asked if he might divorce Maeve and marry one of the bath attendants, whom he had loved for some time. This was granted to him.<br/>I don’t know if Maeve cared. She basked for a while in the glory of having produced a daughter, and really a very pretty one. I saw the little girl when they were parading her around. She was not so pale as her mother. Her skin was like rose petals and her hair like white gold, but she had the same great wide eyes and delicate face.<br/>Yet Maeve, it seems, grew jealous of all the attention paid to her daughter. They caught her pinching the baby when she thought she was alone with it. The infant was taken away, to be raised by Lady Maire, and Maeve found herself in real disgrace for the first time in her life.<br/>Lord Aegeus had no time for her now. All his attentions were focused on little Amelie, the daughter. It was decided that Maeve had performed her duties admirably, and would henceforth be allowed to rest. They allotted her a single room adjacent to the infirmary. She would be given no new husbands, as her health had begun to suffer from constant breeding.<br/>So I asked if I might have her back.<br/><br/>The lords and ladies bestowed her on me gladly enough, commending me for my sense of responsibility, but warned me that marital relations were best not resumed. They didn’t need to say so much. Maeve had become a small wizened thing by this time, collapsed and sagging like an old woman, though she can’t have been thirty yet. Her skin had begun to mar, also, with thick white blotches of scar tissue. The lords and ladies told me it was from too much exposure to sunlight.<br/>But I couldn’t leave her indoors by herself, so I swathed her in a hooded cloak and carried her about with me, and set her in the shade as I worked.<br/>She talked constantly. Mostly it was bitter complaints about the way no one ever brought her presents any more, and how unfair life was. Sometimes she would wander in her mind, and hold long conversations with Fallon. I don’t think she recognized me even when her mind was clear. I wasn’t angry about this. There had been so many, after all, and maybe time and memory weren’t the same for her kind as they were for me. Whatever her kind might be.<br/>I wondered if this was how the immortal ones regard my own race. Are we so brief and small and foolish in their eyes?<br/>Anyway, she didn’t last long.<br/>I had taken the midday meal with her, spooned soup into her toothless mouth</td>

He insisted on squaring everything away before we went back downstairs, and I had to hide a smile at how finicky-neat he was, all his clothes pressed just so and severely grown-up in their cut. He even had a miniature grooming kit in a leather case! Silver-backed brushes and all; he only lacked a razor. Small wonder he looked askance at the toys I’d set out on his bed.<br/>“Sorry about those,” I told him. “I wasn’t expecting somebody quite so, um, mature.”<br/>“It was a charming thought,” he said courteously, giving one of his hats a last brush before setting it on a shelf. “And, after all, it does go with the character I’m portraying. I suppose I’ll need to observe mortal children to see how they behave, won’t I? Certainly all the rest of you seem to be doing a splendid job blending in with the mortal populace.”<br/>“Oh, it’s easy, really,” I assured him. “Easiest part of the job. What’s hard is coordinating the actual running of the station.”<br/>“I can’t wait to observe,” he replied, laying out his monogrammed (!!) towel beside the washbasin. “What shall we start with? Duty rosters? Security protocols? Access code transfers? Logistics?”<br/>Was there a little boy in there at all? The machine part was up and running, trust Labienus to see to that; but we work best as whole people, you know, same as the mortals.<br/>“Logistics,” I replied. “Want to come watch me get dinner for nine people on the table when the cook’s sick?”<br/></td>

<td>And so nothing useful had been done with Nicholas Harpole.<br/>Labienus sighs. So much potential in a bright child, if trained properly. All that splendid ability, wasted on one martyrdom to prop up some distant causal link to Dr. Zeus Incorporated …<br/>Here is a statistic to make his heart bleed over might-have-beens: out of the four hundred seventeen mortals who heard Nicholas preach as he was being burned at the stake, fully twenty-two had heeded his plea to become martyrs to the Protestant cause themselves. Two hundred twelve had gone on to lose their lives in less immediate ways, in the defense of English liberty. Eighty-six more had gone into various levels of what passed for the secret service at that time, working for the downfall of Spain with patient fanaticism under Sir Francis Walsingham. Fifty-one had simply committed suicide, in varying ways, over the three-year period following April 1, 1555.<br/>The point was, of course, that Nicholas Harpole had asked them to die, and they had. Or at least given up their lives. A miserable three hundred seventy-one mortals, when he might have laid waste to nations.<br/>Much better success on the second try. Labienus smiles, coming to the pages added later, the reports from other operatives. He hadn’t minded when the Adonai project had been taken from him. He’d been just settling in here at Mackenzie Base, and had too many irons in the fire to waste time shepherding another hapless youth from one self-destructive crisis to the next. It had helped his ego that the new project head was a close friend, of course.</td>

I’ve watched the mortals crowding into their stinking cities. Their coal-soot advances on the clean sky. The forests go down before their axes and the whales are pulled in and butchered alongside their ships. But, father, it’s not war or crime causing these things. It’s peace. Prosperity. Civilization!”<br/>“We will go after the industrialists, too, when we’re ready.”<br/>“But when will we be ready, father? How badly must it all deteriorate before we move at last?” demanded Labienus, pinning his hopes on sincerity. “You want to exterminate the murderers and generals, but they do the work we should have begun by now. The survival of the world is no longer a moral question, if it ever was. It’s a mechanical question. A matter of numbers.”<br/>“You think we ought to go after the mortals indiscriminately, to protect the earth,” said Budu.<br/><br/>“Yes!”<br/>“You are overruled.

Posing as his own descendant, he has rebuilt his empire. Hearst News Services is an invaluable tool for the Company, and the Hearst museums throughout Europe continue to accrue as much priceless art for Dr. Zeus as the most dedicated team of Preservers.<br/>The idea that the child had been wanted and loved by his parents might figure in the equation, somehow, never even occurs to Labienus.</td>

Your own people hate you for it. They were happy to be conquered by Rome.”<br/>“No,” said the priest, clutching his jaw.

He wore pajamas violently patterned with palm trees and vahines, not at all the kind of thing you’d expect a hunted man to wear. He had a long broken nose, and high broad cheekbones. When he rolled over, he exposed something strange twining up the back of his neck. It looked like a silver tattoo, in a pattern of vaguely Celtic-knot complexity.<br/>It was not a tattoo, however. It was a subcutaneous wire hooking Alec up to the artificial intelligence sailing his ship, for Alec was a cyborg. Not at all some human-machine hybrid with a whirring ocular implant and a toneless voice, oh dear no; that sort of fashion went out generations before Alec was born. In any case, being a peer, he could afford the most elegantly understated cybernetic implants.<br/>So much for what the hypothetical human observer would notice.<br/>It would be rather more likely that a surveillance drone would see all this, zooming in across such distance, noting such detail. And a surveillance drone, having the ability to tune in to the ship’s system, its cameras and indeed to Alec’s own cyborged brain, would see a great deal more.<br/>It would see, for example, two other men lying in the bed, at extreme arm’s length from Alec on either side, who appeared to be his nearly identical brothers.<br/>The virtual man who slept, or tried to sleep, on the left, looked slightly older than the other two. He lay stretched on his side, one hand under his pillow as though groping after something he’d hidden there. He wore only ivory-colored drawers of an antiquated design. His name was, or had been, Edward Alton Bell-Fairfax.<br/>The virtual man on the right was not asleep at all. He lay on his back like an effigy on a tomb, clad in a flowing white shirt of even more antique design, his arms crossed on his chest. He gazed with an expression of despair on the gimbal lamp, which rocked gently as the ship crested each rolling swell, and which had dimmed itself to the comforting glow of a nursery light. He wasn’t comforted. His lips moved for a while in silent prayer. Tears welled in his eyes.<br/>He could hardly be blamed.

Its muzzle was a bare two inches from the face of Nicholas on the right, who recoiled from it. Alec, between them, opened startled eyes but lay motionless, staring at the pistol in confusion.<br/>Any hypothetical human viewer would be confused, too. Without a way to tap into Alec’s brain, he or she would have seen only the man in the bed’s center sitting up, pointing a gun at empty space to his right. And the cold glare and military bearing of the man were not those of anyone who would ever wear vahine-patterned pajamas by choice. This was because virtual Edward had just seized control of Alec’s real body.<br/>Edward! Belay that! said a gruff male voice, from a speaker concealed within a carving of a Spanish galleon. It was the voice of the artificial intelligence that ran the ship, and not—as one might be forgiven for supposing—a pirate hiding behind the panel.<br/>Edward exhaled, shaking, but did not lift the pistol.<br/>“Ghost or no ghost,” he said through his teeth, “if you start that damned praying again, I swear I shall kill you.”<br/>“Do it, Homicide,” said Nicholas, “an thou darest!”<br/>Edward regarded Nicholas, moving the pistol away only regretfully.

<td>Muttering, Edward lay down and punched his virtual pillow savagely.<br/>A word or two of explanation might be helpful at this point. Neither Edward nor Nicholas were ghosts, technically; but during their respective lifetimes each had carried in his brain, quite unknown to himself, a sort of black box. This device recorded in electromagnetic analogue every sensation, thought, and emotion experienced from the moment of its installation (immediately after birth) to the moment of death.<br/>These recordings were made because neither Edward nor Nicholas were human, technically. They were Recombinants, as Alec was, and they had been made (very, very illegally) by an all-powerful cabal of scientists and investors known collectively as Dr. Zeus Incorporated, or more usually just the Company, which also possessed the secret of time travel, among other things.<br/>For reasons that will not be gone into immediately but involved ensuring its own existence, the Company had needed a Recombinant. A prototype was designed, DNA engineered to produce it, and three test embryos cloned from one blastocyst.

<td>The astute reader will have guessed that little Alec had liked pirate stories.<br/>Captain Morgan (as Alec had named his companion) persuaded adolescent Alec to have himself modified with implants, so that he could exist simultaneously in three-dimensional space and in cyberspace with the Captain.<br/>Being a sensible artificial intelligence, the Captain set about solving the mystery of Alec’s existence. Upon discovering that his fairly unhappy childhood could be laid directly at the door of Dr. Zeus Incorporated, Alec and the Captain embarked upon a campaign of revenge and exposure. Unaware they were being cleverly manipulated by the Company to accomplish its goals (I said it was all-powerful) they stole one of the Company’s time shuttles and had a number of adventures that ended more or less disastrously for Alec and a lot of other people, though not for the Company.<br/>With its purpose for Alec fulfilled, the Company relaxed, confident in the expectation of his disposal when the time shuttle exploded, as it was scheduled to do. This failed to happen, however, because:<br/>In the course of his adventures with the time shuttle, Alec blundered into a Company penal institution located deep in prehistory. There he encountered one of the Company’s cyborg slaves, the hapless Botanist Mendoza, an immortal marooned in the past for reasons which included her knowledge of the Company’s Recombinant project. She had discovered Project Adonai by sheerest chance, when she had the misfortune to encounter, fall in love with, and fail to prevent the untimely deaths of first Nicholas and then, three hundred years later, Edward.<br/>She was, moreover, a Crome generator, the only immortal with a bizarre condition cursing its possessors with apparent psychic ability. Consequently her emotional health was not quite what was desired in an immortal, which was another reason she’d been confined to the agricultural station.<br/>Upon meeting Alec, Mendoza slept with him, accepted his proposal of marriage, and passed on to him certain classified information to assist him in his goal of bringing down Dr. Zeus Incorporated. She also disconnected the explosive device on the shuttle that was intended to destroy Alec once his usefulness to the Company ended.<br/>When, after several tragic accidents, Alec managed to equip his very large yacht with a time transcendence drive so he could go back to rescue Mendoza, he discovered that Dr. Zeus Incorporated had got there first. The unfortunate lady had been arrested again, and consigned to some even more obscure prison. Plundering Company files in his furious attempts to discover where she had been</td>

Most unwisely, he downloaded the whole thing, learning thereby the extremely unsavory truth about his own existence and, moreover, receiving the entire contents of both Nicholas’s and Edward’s black boxes.<br/>Alec promptly had a nervous breakdown. Goodness, wouldn’t you, at this point? And, unable to assimilate Nicholas’s or Edward’s memories, Alec developed a disassociative personality disorder and gave them independent individual existences, complete with virtual physical bodies in cyberspace.<br/>At least, that was the only rational explanation for what happened.<br/>After attempting (and failing) to administer drugs to banish Alec’s unwelcome guests, the Captain decided to let them stay, since both Nicholas and Edward had strengths and skills that might prove useful to Alec.<br/>Got it? All clear so far?<br/>The Captain’s experiment was not proving an unqualified success, since the three Recombinant gentlemen discovered they couldn’t stand their own company, and struggled constantly for control of the one real body they shared. One thing upon which they did agree, however, was the urgent necessity of finding and rescuing Mendoza.<br/>To this end, they hunted down their guilty creators and extracted at gunpoint the name of the prison where Mendoza was now confined: a site known only as Options Research.<br/>Then they fled, away through time to an empty night ocean, where they were presently attempting to rest while the Captain devised a plan for Mendoza’s rescue.</td>

A tiny holoprojection cone emerged from the camera and seconds later a man appeared to stand beside the bed, big, black-bearded and villainous-looking, though his expression was kindly. Nicholas stared, fascinated even as he was repelled. He jumped when a hologram of a chair materialized behind the Captain, who sat down into it. “There now. Nothing to frighten thee.”<br/>“I charge thee, Spirit, tell me! Dost thou serve the devil?” Nicholas demanded.<br/>“No, sir, not I.”<br/>“Dost thou serve God, then?”<br/>“Well, no, sir, being what I am, which is to say no more than a device. I was made to serve Alec, sir, d’you see? Like a clock or a lute, to tell him the hour or cheer his heart. Or a dog, to guard him as he sleeps. Too low a creature to be damned or saved. Therefore, fear me not.”<br/>“How canst thou speak with a man’s voice?” asked Nicholas.<br/>The Captain waved his hand dismissively. “Why, sir, even a bird may be taught speech, mayn’t he, a raven or a parrot? Wherefore not then a clever mechanism? If a jack can be made to strike the hour in a clock, he may be made to speak, too; and such am I. Speak with me, then, and ease thy sick grief.”<br/>Nicholas stared at him, marveling at the detail of the illusion: the movement of the Captain’s beard when he spoke, the creak of the insubstantial chair when he shifted his weight.<br/>“But I am no more than thou art,” Nicholas said at last, bitterly. “A made thing, an alchemical homunculus. How shouldst thou comfort my soul, when neither thou nor I have souls, but only spirits? So might a clock comfort an astrolabe.”<br/>“Ah, well, sir, I’ve no soul, to be sure; but it might help to talk, all the same.”<br/>Nicholas lay back with a sigh, and gazed at the lamp.<br/>“I have been disputing with myself,” he said, “since I have awakened into this unnatural life of horrible marvels, on the nature of Almighty God.”<br/>“And how doth that make thee feel, lad?” inquired the Captain.

<td>The Pelican had been there a long time. It was rumored to have been transplanted, brick by brick, from some English village, back in the twentieth century when wealthy men still did things like that. It was named for the ship in which Sir Francis Drake had set out when he’d sailed off to loot the Spanish Main.<br/>It had once been a very expensive bed-and-breakfast hotel, bar, and five-star restaurant. Various wars, political secessions, and natural disasters had altered its fortunes. Over three centuries it had been successively a triage hospital, a barricaded freeholding, a farmhouse, a partial ruin, and other things. But, situated as it was at a crossroads in a picturesque cove, as soon as civilization had reasserted itself enough to provide some traffic, the Pelican had evolved back into an inn.<br/>Even a reasonably prosperous one, in this year of 2317. Plenty of trade from the local farmers and fishermen. Plenty of real money from the rich people who moored their pleasure boats in Muir Harbor, eager to get away from the General Prohibition in San Francisco.<br/>Not that there was anything all that immoral to be had at the Pelican, of course, beyond homemade ciders and ales and fish dinners. Mavis paid a fortune in bribes to local law enforcement to be able to serve even those; but the people from the big boats wanted the thrill of the forbidden, and spent hugely for it.<br/>Sometimes Mavis paid the local law enforcement to dress as picturesque smugglers, too, and they would lounge in her bar and leer pleasantly at the guests, or tell stories about desperate chases over the hills with kegs of mead. The guests would buy them drinks and would usually stay over an extra night. The local economy thrived to no end.<br/>Joseph saw the amber windows</td>

It’s useful being a cyborg, even a rogue one, when you have to realign a holoemitter. Mortals think you’re an itinerant electronics genius, and so it’s all right that you’re a faintly shabby little man who never seems to have much money.<br/>Joseph didn’t really need the tools, but he made a great show of using them anyway, and presently the holo images resolved and sharpened into one image, brilliantly clear in the dark midair: Mars, with the glassy dome and radiating green lines of the Martian Agricultural Collective near its equator, as a solemn voice lauded the courage of the first settlers sponsored by Areco. There was a half-hearted cheer from the patrons in the dart alley.<br/>Joseph shivered, thinking that today’s courageous settlers were tomorrow’s vicious terrorists.

He leaped down and took a little bow, then turned to the bar expectantly.<br/>“So, am I good or am I good?”<br/>By way of answer the bartender thrust the big embossed glass mug into Joseph’s hand.

As long as you’re here, you might look at a couple of other things that need realigning,” she told him quietly, slipping a key into his hand. “And take a shower first.

What’s that mean?”<br/>“I shall ignore your infantile humor and will be happy to explain, since you’ve inquired,” said Edward condescendingly. “I have formulated a theory of cycles of development in the history of mankind. They repeat in ever-expanding patterns, producing ages of Technology, Faith, and Reason.”<br/>“Oh, that’s crap.”<br/>“No, it isn’t. Technology was the first age, when primordial Man crawled from his dark shelter and discovered that by the simple expedient of striking flints in various ways he could provide himself with both fire and weapons,” Edward said. “Will you grant me that?”<br/>“Okay,” said Alec grudgingly. “And?”<br/>“And so the brute beast found himself, as it were, master of his universe. He had, of course, no idea of any consequences. He simply forged ahead, lighting fires and making spears, as fast as his clumsy hands could go. The result was, potentially, a greater lifespan for Man, but new and terrible responsibilities which he utterly ignored,” said Edward.<br/>“Nowadays you’re supposed to say Humanity, you know. There were women back then, too,” Alec told him.<br/>“Allow me my metaphor, if you please,” snapped Edward. “To continue: over the ages, the consequences of Technology did begin to make themselves evident to primitive Man. Fires, and bloodier warfare, prompted fear in his dim mind. With so much death in evidence, it was impossible not to wonder about his own inevitable demise. This prompted shamans to caper about and pretend their ancestors were giving them advice on the problem, and so was born the First Age of Faith.”<br/>“And everybody went to Hell?” said Alec. Nicholas snorted.<br/>“Not at all. Religion’s quite useful, at a certain level. It provides a notion of moral behavior and, as such, is the origin of ethics,” said Edward, steepling his fingers. “It is, at least, a system of thought, if it doesn’t degrade into mysticism. It got Man’s attention away from how he might more effectively spear his neighbor long enough to allow Civilization to begin.”<br/></td>

In any case, Order took form out of Chaos, and pure rational thought, Man’s highest achievement, leapt into existence!” said Edward with relish. “It attained its fullest expression amongst the classical Greeks, but the Romans applied it with the greatest effectiveness. Systematically and logically they spread Civilization throughout the known world, to a degree that was not equaled for a thousand years.”<br/>“The Romans were vile and depraved,” said Nicholas, setting the text plaquette aside.<br/>“They became so,” Edward agreed. “They discarded the disciplines that had made them strong. With no moral code informing their lives, life became meaningless. This coincided with what one might call the Second Age of Technology. The superior engineering skills, the advances in metallurgy, all the tremendous and brilliant machine of their empire roared along with no purpose other than serving the appetite of its creators, who had no thought for the inescapable consequences any more than brute Man with his flints had.”<br/>“Well?” said Alec. “So what happened?”<br/>“The judgment of God came on Rome,” said Nicholas.<br/>“Absurd! Rome fell because of errors in its judgment,” Edward argued heatedly. “Without rational guidance the great machine destroyed itself, and so followed the Second Age of Faith.”<br/>“The Dark Ages of Christianity, right?” said Alec. Nicholas turned to him with an expression of outrage and Edward snickered. “It’s true,” Alec insisted. “And it wasn’t just Christianity. Islam happened, too. All those people beheaded and burned at the stake over nothing, man.”<br/>“Ay. Nothing,” Nicholas agreed sullenly. “Sacrifices offered up to a God of bestial cruelty. Yet even so, in that Dark Age, who but Christ’s disciples had thy precious Civilization in their keeping? Who but they, and the Jew, and the Moor with his Koran, made books and schools, lest that Aristotle become a mute ghost? It was Faith sustained knowledge.”<br/>“And sold men pieces of the True Cross,” said Edward slyly. “And pretended to</td>

You and Erasmus and Luther and all the rest who finally had the courage to use the damned brains God gave ’em!”<br/>“Because they told the Pope to go shrack himself?” inquired Alec.<br/>“Because they began the Renaissance, which led to the Enlightenment. The Second Age of Reason,” Edward crowed. “True science and clear thinking at last! An Empire with real moral purpose.”<br/>“Oh, hark at the Crown of Creation,” jeered Nicholas. “I’ve seen the dust wherein thine Empire fell. Rags, shrouds and cobwebs! Love was no part of its design, but only profit, and its loveless heart went to ashes at last. And thou too art humbled in thy pride, and liest here a phantom like me, dead and forgotten.”<br/>Edward considered him, tight-lipped. “That remains to be proven,” he said at last. “And if the great wheel brought my age to an end, it will turn again.”<br/>“The Enlightenment didn’t stop,” said Alec. “It’s still going on. We got out into space, didn’t we? We’ve got more science than you ever had.”<br/>“No; you have Technology,” said Edward, a little wearily. “Tremendous power, wielded unwisely. The rest of human knowledge has been jettisoned as unnecessary. You’re illiterate, you believe in nothing, your lives have no meaning, no moral compass, no point.”<br/>“Maybe because we’ve learned something you haven’t,” said Alec in a cold voice. “You and your logical systems! You think you know everything. There’s nothing to know, man, except that our genes will do anything to copy themselves. What makes you imagine the world is a rational place?”<br/>“Your world isn’t, to be sure,” Edward replied. “And unless I’m mistaken, the next Age of Faith is already looming on the horizon, in the person of the Ephesian Church. Serves you right, too.”<br/>Alec shuddered.<br/>“But if it’s all just this big wheel going around endlessly—then we’re right, believing in nothing,” he said. “There is no point.”<br/>“Yes, there is,” said Edward and Nicholas together.<br/>“There is Love,” said Nicholas.<br/>“There is Progress! And if, just once, a new cycle began that unified, rather than rejected the advances made by the previous ages,” said Edward, “if Faith were able to make its peace with Reason, or Technology able to grasp the principles and purpose of the other two, Mankind might make real progress at last! Don’t you see that once we’ve brought the Company down, our true work can begin?”</td>

It remained still as a doll until he scrubbed its face; then it put up a hand in a feeble protective gesture, as if imploring mercy, and his heart broke.<br/>“Mendoza, it’s all right, it’s me,” Alec said. “Wake up, baby, please, you’re safe now. I came back for you!”<br/>He flung away the towel and massaged with his hands. Then he stopped, in confusion: for the skin was fine and soft as an infant’s.<br/>“She—she’s younger,” he said.<br/>She were only fourteen when the immortality process was completed. The nanobots reset her. Don’t worry, son. She’ll fill out over the next couple of years.<br/>“But—!” Alec’s voice rose to a shriek of dismay, as he frantically willed his imbecile flesh to stand down.<br/>“No,” said Nicholas in horror. “God’s death, fool, she’s little and young!”<br/>“Oh, don’t be an idiot,” said Edward hoarsely. “She’s older than Time now. What better way to bring her back to life?” He advanced across the bed, grinning. Alec felt him beginning to seize control and fought vainly; but then Nicholas gripped Edward and their wills collided like an earthquake, and Alec could do no more than cling to Mendoza as they struggled.<br/>“Please,” he said. “Mendoza, I’m so sorry. Look, it’ll be just like a story. Okay? I’ll kiss you, and that’ll break the spell. Oh, please—!”<br/>He clamped his mouth on the unresisting mouth and kissed desperately.<br/>She shuddered to life in his arms, writhing suddenly, and took her first gasping breath from him. He lifted his mouth, rising on his elbows as her eyes opened.<br/>They went wide with alarm. She made a terrified sound and backed away into the pillow, staring at him.<br/>“Don’t be scared! It’s me, it’s just me,” Alec said. “See, sweetheart? We saved you.”<br/>Nicholas and Edward froze in their struggle, watching. She had frozen, too, her face blank and unreadable as an animal’s.

Edward made an elegant gesture of dismissal.<br/>Oh yeah?<br/>Yes. If only you had the power to envision it, Alec! Eternal summer and eternal youth in which to enjoy eternal love. You might wander with our lady, hand in hand, down any empty beach in any age of the world, like two innocents in Paradise! And what harm could you do anyone, then? When we worked our evil, you and I, we did so out of grim resolution and duty. We believed we must sacrifice our own happiness to improve the lot of mankind. Edward shook his head sadly. He looked into Alec’s eyes and his voice was smooth, suave, infinitely persuasive.<br/>If we’d followed our hearts and run away with the girl, all this misery might have been avoided. Ah, but now we have the chance! Break the pattern of your own death, as she so hoped you would.

I’ll have the damn immortality operation, or whatever it is.<br/>That’s my little Alec.<br/>After what she’s been through, this is the least I can do for her. Especially if it’s the only way we can keep her safe.<br/>Good lad, purred Edward. A sensible choice and, moreover, a moral one.<br/>Why, son, it ain’t going to be no harder than getting yer tattoo. It’ll just take a little longer. You might say this is Nature taking her right and proper course, aye.<br/>But Alec turned to Nicholas.<br/>Do you think it’s the right thing to do?<br/>Nicholas looked down at Mendoza as she slept.<br/>Go on, Nick. You been studying religion; tell him it’s right.<br/>Ay, Nicholas said. Since it is done for love’s sake. What other law is left?<br/>Alec nodded slowly.<br/>That’s my good Nick! Now that we’re all square, Alec, there’s things we need to consider. I can start you on the Pineal Tribrantine Three straight off. The place we’re stuck, I reckon, is that there crucible of prime DNA you were made from. I’ve already lifted the file for Adonai out of Dr. Zeus’s archives. I even got biomechanicals designed what’s better than the Company uses! Every one of ’em a molecular Philosopher’s Stone. But I need that DNA for a genetic template. Think of it like a treasure map, Alec, what’ll tell the little bastards where they got to go for the loot.<br/>Then obviously the next step is to locate the crucible, said Edward, and take it. Would it be a silver tube like the one in Mendoza’s file?<br/>Aye, sir, likely, or a bit bigger. You were a lot more valuable, being an experimental prototype, so they’d have made a bucket of it.<br/></td>

Its conclusions were: that Crome’s radiation somehow caused an individual’s electromagnetic field to bleed over into the temporal field, which perhaps caused what appeared to be precognition or déjà vu in certain mortals. Also, telekinesis could perhaps be explained by Crome’s causing a disruption in the temporal field, freezing objects briefly in time while space (following its normal orbital trajectory) swung out from under them. This perhaps accounted for documented cases of solid objects appearing to leap off shelves or float through midair, or even rain down out of a cloudless sky.<br/>It might also account for the ongoing phenomena with the garden, wherein plants shot from seed to maturity in a night. Mendoza seldom generated Crome’s on these occasions, but did seem to be able to produce the temporal distortion at will. Just how she did it remained a mystery. She had not volunteered any explanation, apparently under the impression that Alec also had the ability, and neither he nor the Captain had considered it wise to disabuse her of this idea yet.<br/>The Captain made calculations, drew up tables.

There was a moment of sizzling silence before he whooped:<br/>“We can get anything here!” A couple of aproned clerks and customers turned to stare at them, and he lowered his voice immediately. “We’ll just, er, pretend we buy groceries like this every day. Come on. See those carts? You’re supposed to take one and push it around in front of you. You just go up and down the aisles, putting things you want in it. Okay?”<br/>Which is what they did, as soon as they’d figured out how to get through the turnstile. Each took a cart and the man turned immediately to the right, into the meat department, and the girl followed. Here they prowled along the open butcher’s bin, exclaiming to each other in hushed tones at how tidily it was all presented, every cut individually packaged in its own little white tray and wrapped in transparent film. The man seemed surprised that there was no mutton or goose to be had, and precious little veal; but he loaded huge bleeding clods of beef roast into his cart with both hands, and the girl concentrated on the beautifully plucked and dressed chickens. Neither of them touched the ground meats.<br/>Reining themselves in with visible effort, they pushed on. The man was astonished by the selection of cheeses, took whole wheels. The nonedible items fascinated them, too; they stared and whispered, or giggled together until they were red-faced. They seemed greatly impressed by the canned goods, and selected the ones with the brightest labels. The jars of preserves and jellies captivated them; they took at least one of every color, and several jars of honey. They loaded up on coffees and teas.</td>

While they wait for their pizza, the young lady strikes up a conversation with the elderly gardener, who is setting a baby tree in the deep hole that has been dug for it.<br/>He’s astonished to discover how well she speaks the dialect of his village, and how much she knows on the subject of date palms. They engage in a lengthy conversation that ends only when the project foreman stalks up, demanding impatiently that the gardener finish planting the damned palm.<br/>The young couple excuse themselves and finish their pizza. The old gardener goes back to shoveling earth around the roots of the little palm.

He finishes planting the palm and says a quiet prayer, hoping the new tree will thrive, as the young couple tidy up their table and leave.<br/>His prayer will in fact be answered.

He had appeared in the common room of the Goat and Compasses one night in 1660 with no belongings other than a small sea chest and the clothes on his back. After a meal, a warming glass of rum, and an hour’s charming conversation, he had somehow taken up the position in Miss Venables’s life that he had occupied, with few interruptions, ever since.<br/>And really she could not, in any way, admit that she regretted the nuptial arrangement. In addition to his considerable proficiency in the arts of love, Dr. Ansolabehere was quiet and clean, and never attempted to exert control over the household although he was, as she discovered, an excellent financial advisor. He was a capable surgeon (which even the most genteel of taverns required now and then), did not drink to excess, and tolerated her occasional infidelities with the greatest amiability. Best of all, he had an absolutely reliable remedy for the Pox.<br/>There were only two peculiarities about the man: his obstinate refusal to market the remedy, which Mrs. Ansolabehere found most vexing, for it might have earned them more than six sugar plantations if sold freely in Port Royal; and his sea chest.<br/>The sea chest was quite small, quite heavy, and never opened. Indeed, as far as Mrs. Ansolabehere knew its lock had no key. This need not present any difficulty for a determined woman with the proper hairpin, but Dr. Ansolabehere seldom let it out of his sight.

If at any time during his temporary absence from the house the sea chest should begin to whistle, she was to let him know immediately, regardless of where he might be or what he might be doing. So firmly had he insisted upon this, and with such an unpleasant and unaccustomed light of adamance in his black eyes, that Mrs. Ansolabehere had been quite unsettled for some hours afterward.<br/>Judge, then, with what vexation Mrs. Ansolabehere received the news from Caroline, her maid, that there was an odd sound coming from Dr. Ansolabehere’s room; especially since this news was conveyed whilst Mrs. Ansolabehere was greeting none other than the Lieutenant Governor himself, Captain Sir Henry Morgan, who had arrived with a party of friends and was intent on aggravating his dropsy with a few hours’determined application of Mrs. Ansolabehere’s best rum.<br/>“What?” she hissed over her shoulder at Caroline.<br/>“It be squealing, ma’am,” repeated Caroline.<br/>“Why then, go—go poke under the bed with a broom, sure,” Mrs. Ansolabehere said. “Away! My apologies, Sir Henry. Here is my best table, with a cool breeze from the door, and here is John to serve. Will you dine, too? For I assure you I have an excellent hotpot on the fire.”<br/>“No damn’d soup,” growled Sir Henry, lifting his haggard face. “I’ve enough water in me as it is.” He did not resemble the dumpy self-satisfied fellow depicted in Exquemelin’s notorious Buccaneers of America (a careful examination of its illustrations will reveal that all the pirates in that lurid compendium seem to be drawn from one model) but rather the other attributed likeness, the shadowy three-quarter portrait of the dark saturnine man in red, smiling enigmatically as the Mona Lisa. “Rum, madam! And ginger biscuits if you’ve got ’em.”<br/>“To be sure,” Mrs. Ansolabehere said. “Sent hot to the table, sir, within the hour!”<br/>She and Annie, the cook, were frantically getting a pan of ginger biscuits into the oven when Caroline reappeared in the doorway of the kitchen, clutching a broom.<br/>“It be still squealing, ma’am,” she said, close to tears. “And it ain’t under the doctor’s bed, ma’am. It be the little chest what’s squealing, ma’am.”<br/>Upon hearing this, Mrs. Ansolabehere swore an oath, gathered up her skirts, and ran upstairs to see for herself.</td>

So swiftly, too, did the glowing numbers climb, as Edward’s score reached 5000.<br/>A fanfare sounded and the letters above the globe flashed purple:<br/>YOU HAVE REACHED THE SECOND LEVEL! HAIL, DEATH-DEALER! HAIL, DEATH-DEALER! HAIL, DEATH-DEALER!<br/>And a new legion of enemies sped toward him out of the bloody ball, every human monster imaginable, guilty of all possible crimes and ugly as the crimes themselves, glimpsed for no more than a fleeting second before shredding to pieces. The game went on longer this time, but only because there were twice as many opponents. Edward was playing faster still.<br/>The console housing the game began to hum faintly.<br/>Edward scored 100,000 and the game began again without preamble. They were demons, now, hurling themselves at him and dissolving in blood-bursts of all colors, grotesques, and they came apart and surged back as the others had not, so that he was sometimes facing more than one opponent at a time. Though he was shifting now slightly from side to side within the body frame, his speed of kill diminished not one iota and his score rose inexorably toward 1,000,000. He wasn’t even sweating, though his face was pale and set.<br/>The console, however, was now whining distinctly.</td>

Follow the coast down through the western Sahara or go back through the mountains and strike out inland, make for the Blue Nile and follow it up.

What if one of those rows of gleaming tubes was unable to maintain optimum temperature? The thought was enough to make David shudder. In fact, sometimes he woke with nightmares about it, and had to plug himself in for a midnight visit to the Office, just to make certain nothing of the sort had happened.<br/>And of course nothing ever had, because the Company had installed all possible backup systems, in addition to maintaining rigorous servicing schedules. Still—<br/>If the stuff in the gleaming tubes was to spoil, it wouldn’t be stored medicine or experiments that would be lost; oh, no. It would be whole races of humanity.<br/>As it had been explained to David long ago, genetic diversity was very, very important.

When Queans cried, they cried proudly, noisily and angrily, because they hadn’t been given enough presents, and not because they were little and alone in the dark.<br/>It was the Memory that sent Tiara poking through the trash rooms, where the panel light was dimmed because of all the piled clutter.

<td>The slaves were evil; the big people sent them to plunder poor little kin and steal their clever works. They had always done this, and the kin hadn’t ever been able to stop them until one day, at last, a clever Uncle had devised a way to break the slaves. He’d even succeeded in catching one; though the slave had gotten away after. Such a long time, then, the Uncles had hunted for the slave, trying to catch him again, and many Uncles had been lost. It had become one of the epic stories of their race.<br/>Though he had been finally captured, of course; kin never gave up when they wanted something. It was one of the things that made them better than the big people.<br/>Why, it had been Tiara’s own kin who had captured the slave at last, famous Uncle Zingo! Though he was dust now, poor old thing, but famous dust anyhow. And Uncle Ratlin himself had been the one to kill the slave, trying and trying with the different inventions until he’d made one that was deadly enough to do the job. Tiara didn’t understand the big words and concepts that the Memory gave her, about biomechanicals and electromagnetic pulses and disruption, but it had been a great day indeed for Uncle Ratlin when he’d finally killed the slave.<br/>Ever since, Uncle Ratlin had gone more and more among the big people, about his business in broad daylight even, and brought home wonderful presents for Quean Barbie. There was a great plan that was going to make them all very happy one day, that would avenge the kin and bring about the ruin of the big people and their slaves forever, and it all hinged on Uncle Ratlin’s invention.</td>

He would do, she decided, for pretend kin.<br/>But what could you play with a thing that couldn’t talk back to you? Tiara thought about it and her little face brightened. She ran off to her own hiding place and returned in a moment, carrying the pink and green acrylic afghan and a beer bottle she had filled with spring water. Sitting down beside the dead slave, she pulled his head and shoulders into her lap and awkwardly wrapped him in the afghan; then she tilted the bottle to his lips, pretending to feed him, spilling water down his waxen face.<br/>“Pretty little baby, pretty little baby,” Tiara crooned. “Drink your nice milk and go to sleep.”<br/>She had, like all the rest of her race, the power of absolute concentration on what interested her at the moment, fixation to a degree that would baffle one of the big people. So intent on her game was she, it mattered nothing to her that the dead slave trembled abruptly, that his mouth opened and fastened on the neck of the bottle, that he proceeded to gulp down the water.<br/>“Good little baby,” Tiara sang approvingly. “Such a good baby, he drinks it all gone. Isn’t he clever! Mummy’s very pleased with him.”<br/>The slave lay still, gasping for breath. She lifted the bottle away and he moved his lips as though he were speaking, but Tiara couldn’t hear anything. “Oh, he’s parched, he’s parched and dry, he needs a whiskey to tell that story!” she sang. “Does he want a whiskey, then?”<br/>The slave might have nodded, or it might have been a shiver. Tiara decided to play it for a nod and jumped up, running off to the spring for more water. She returned in triumph and settled back down, lifting his head and holding the bottle for him. “Drink, drink!” she chanted. “And grow up big and strong.”<br/>He finished the water and sighed, and his head sagged back on her arm. His lips moved again and this time she heard him speak, distinctly, a whisper of thanks.<br/>“He can talk to me,” she squealed in delight. “Talk to me more, slave!”<br/>His eyes opened.

You were supposed to be dead.”<br/>“Oh, but—” How rapid the slave’s breathing became. “You don’t want him to be mad, do you? And if you tell him I’m still alive, he’ll want to kill me again. And if he does that, I won’t be able to talk to you. You see?”<br/>Tiara saw. “It’s a secret,” she decided.<br/>“Oh, yes, Princess Tiara, it’s our secret. Please?” The slave’s voice shook. “You won’t tell anyone I’m alive in here, and I can talk to you, and play all the games you like.”<br/>“But you’re broken,” Tiara pointed out.<br/>“Well, that’s true, but I might get better. I’m sure I would, if I had enough time,” the slave argued earnestly. “I couldn’t even talk or think before, and then you gave me water to drink, and just listen to me now! I’m talking and thinking like mad.”<br/>“I’ll get you more water,” Tiara announced.<br/>She got up and ran from the room, not noticing his cries of: “Wait! Little girl! Princess! Oh, please, for gods’ sake, don’t leave me!” When she came back after refilling the bottle, he turned his face at once as he heard her come in. “Princess Tiara?” he called desperately.<br/>“Don’t cry, little baby,” she said, putting the bottle to his mouth. He gasped and drank again, so quickly some of the water spilled and ran down like his tears.<br/>“Thank you, sweet little princess,” he gasped.<br/>“I like that.” She smiled. “Tell me I’m a sweet little princess again.”<br/>“Oh, you are! You’re the dearest, sweetest little princess there’s ever been.”<br/>“Tell me you love me.”<br/>“I love you!”<br/>“And I love you,” she emoted, clasping her hands together and tossing her head back. “You are my perfect treasure, and I die for wanting you!”<br/>The slave’s mouth worked oddly. “My dearest love, you must never die,” he cried. “Surely if you die the stars will all go out!”<br/></td>

If only I could see! Will you look for me, dear little princess, and tell me: have I still got both my legs?”<br/>Dutifully Tiara leaned over and looked, though she knew perfectly well. “Yes,” she sang. “Ten fingers and ten toes, why, he’s perfect!”<br/>“Both my feet are still there, then? And my arms and hands?”<br/>“Yes, my treasure.”<br/>“Apollo be thanked. Am I cut, my dearest? Have I wounds anywhere?”<br/>“My poor brave hero.” Tiara pretended to weep. “They have murdered you entirely, there is blood in your beautiful golden hair.”<br/>“Is there?” The slave blinked, frowning. “Yes. I remember that. He tried to open my skull. So there’s a wound in my head, my love?”<br/>“Uh-huh.”<br/>“Ha. Well, don’t trouble your heart, my darling.” The slave ran his tongue over his lips. “If you’ll look after me—if you’ll bring me water and food—my body will have what it needs to begin repairing itself. I don’t know how badly I’m damaged, but if I can regain some function—any function—” The slave began to tremble, and calmed himself. “Why, what a grand time we’ll have. And I can tell you stories—do you like stories, Princess Tiara?”<br/>“Oh, yes,” she assured him.<br/>“Well then! Do you know, I was a Literature Preservation Specialist—” The slave’s voice broke. He swallowed hard and went on, “And what that means is, I know every story in the wide world. I will be your own storyteller, princess dear, and nobody else will have such fine stories told. Only to you will I tell them. Will you like that?”<br/>“More than anything, my prince,” said Tiara and sighed. Then, in a completely sensible voice, she added, “Except you aren’t really a prince. You’re just my slave.”<br/>“Ah! Yes, but only your slave,” he insisted. “I would be slave to none but the beautiful Princess Tiara. I’m afraid if you tell anybody I’m here, they’ll come take me away from you.”<br/>“Nobody will do that,” Tiara told him, patting his cheek. She knew how to keep secrets.</td>

With that exception there was no day or night, no sense of days or weeks passing or what that might mean.<br/>But there were the stories, and the little rhymes the slave knew. For a long while there was Cinderella and Puss in Boots and Hickory Dickory Dock, intoned in his weary patient voice from the moment Tiara yawned and sat up until the moment she’d yawn and snuggle down beside him.

There were snails. The slave had shuddered at these, at first, and then made a game that they were escargot with garlic butter in white wine sauce. Sometimes Tiara would creep down to the farm and take anything that appealed to her from the big man’s kitchen, and sometimes things from his yard. Once there were towels left out to dry on the line overnight, and Tiara carried them away gleefully; for as her slave began to get better he could feel the cold, and she liked to wrap warm things about his shivering body, or wad them between him and the stony floor.<br/>As Tiara got older and more skillful she learned to milk the big beasts into a jar, and would carry it back to her slave with scarcely a drop spilled. Then they’d feast on the cream, and with his throat refreshed the slave could go on with the astonishing stories, about Jason and the Argonauts, about Odysseus, about Rama and Sita.<br/>Tiara loved her slave. With just a little food and care he became much nicer to look at: the wound in his head healed over and he regained use of one of his arms, dragging himself upright to lean against a wall. Nor was he loud, as the big people were, but soft-spoken, and as self-effacing as the stupids that served Quean Barbie. Tiara assumed this was because he was a slave.<br/>The only trouble she would ever have with him was when he would cry. Sometimes he’d begin to cry and be unable to stop, and shouting at him or stamping her feet never helped; so she learned those were the times to play Mummy, and kiss the tears from his cheeks (she liked the salty flavor) and stroke</td>

Down in the dark, Princess Tiara drank of a different brew, began to grow into another kind of Quean entirely.<br/>Her tastes did form around romances, as she grew. Every tale of chivalry and passion the slave had ever sung when he’d been a troubadour, she loved: Tristan and Isolde, Arthur and Guinevere, Pelleas and Melisande. Every jongleur ditty about Robin and Marian. All the Shakespeare love plays, acted out in the slave’s beautiful voice and with the gestures of his one good hand. Heathcliff and Cathy, Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester enchanted Tiara. When he recited Alfred Noyes’s The Highwayman for her, she wanted it every night after that for years.<br/>Princess Tiara grew small high breasts, and began to develop a certain interest in the slave’s anatomy. No use; he couldn’t make those parts work, damaged as he was, and he explained that it wasn’t good for a little girl to start that sort of play too early anyway. Carefully, phrasing with exquisite tact, he made a request. She agreed, and the next night she went down to the farmhouse and rummaged around in the big man’s bedroom as he slept. She returned in triumph with a pair of thin cotton dress trousers, and helped the slave pull them on over his nakedness. Once his man parts were covered she forgot all about them. He did look so funny, with the big baggy trousers rolled up on his thin legs!<br/>But the clothes made him happy, and Tiara liked making her slave happy.<br/>Now that she had breasts, now that he had trousers, the long hours of talk changed.

I know what it is. You’re scared of the old bitch. Sweetie, precious babe, she’s old. And think of the kin. If you don’t come back, honey love, what’ll we all do? No new stupids to make things, no new Uncles to plot for us! And there’s such plotting to be done, now that we’ve almost got the delivery system perfected.

Wear her clothes? Sleep in her sheets? You reek of her, you faithless bastard.” And she gave Uncle Ratlin what she hoped was an imperious stare.<br/>To her great delight he cringed and whined.

I shall set you a task, and if it is fulfilled to the letter, I shall be yours; but only then.”<br/>What a thrill, to see Uncle Ratlin stand speechless with amazement, and annoyance, and respect!

The only thing on which the three gentlemen wholeheartedly agreed was the fact that they loved Mendoza, who had known each of them in their successive incarnations.<br/>Nicholas Harpole, who lived in the sixteenth century and was a scholar and heretic, managed to adjust somehow to massive culture shock and loss of the foundation on which his religious beliefs stood; but then he was an extraordinary man.<br/>So was Edward Alton Bell-Fairfax.<br/>Edward lived in the nineteenth century and was a political agent for the British Empire. He absorbed all the virtues and most of the vices of that massive institution, along with the cold-blooded practicality that enabled him to do his very unpleasant job. He died heroically in the service of the Gentlemen’s Speculative Society, an earlier version of Dr. Zeus Incorporated. His subsequent discovery that they lied to him most of his brief life has not been received well and, unfortunately for his creators, Edward has read Frankenstein.<br/>He doesn’t think much of his other selves, either.<br/>He dismisses Nicholas as a medieval zealot, limited by ignorance and religious superstition. Cybergenius Alec is in his opinion a dunce, the inevitable product of a soft and degenerate age, and worse: for Alec had been naïve enough to smuggle weapons to a particularly foolhardy group of rebels, and the result had been the destruction of an entire colony on Mars. Hence Alec’s flight, with technology he’d stolen from Dr. Zeus, into the past.<br/>Edward’s perception of these other selves has decided him that he alone is fit to inhabit Alec’s body. His effort to achieve this state of independence has been partly responsible for the accident that brought him, maimed and broken, to the regeneration tank, and Mendoza to her present state of impairment, and Alec and Nicholas to … well, to the place they now inhabit.<br/>But even if the accident had not occurred, Edward’s efforts to kill Alec should have been in vain. Edward is, after all, only a recording, nothing more than a program Alec himself is running, in disassociation response to the psychic trauma of having two additional lifetimes thrust into his memory. Or is he? Why can’t Edward be shut off?<br/>And what exactly has happened to Alec and Nicholas?</td>

<td>So I suppose we’re omnipresent now. Omnitemporal? But not truly omnipotent, as Edward hastens to correct me: “Only to the limits of my observational ability, my dear.”<br/>It appears that the truth about Time is rather more complex than we were told in school. Dr. Zeus explained to its little cyborgs that mortals perceive time in a linear way, because they have no other frame of reference; but in reality (they said) it is more of a spiral than a line, and when you learn to step across from one part of the spiral to another, you can travel through time. It would seem, however, that the Company wasn’t telling the truth. As usual.<br/>Whoever first learned how to travel in time, whether it was the Company or those little pale people from whom it stole its technology—it appears they took one look at the awful incoherent vastness of it all, screamed, and hastily projected conduits of artificial linear time with which to travel through the mess in a more or less orderly way. The restriction against being able to travel forward in time was a result of the conduit system. Real time is nonlinear, chaos, all-simultaneous, extending through every direction and dimension at once, and Edward alone knows what this does to causality. Entropy is an artifact of mortal perception.<br/>We, of course, are beyond all that now, ascended beings that we are.</td>

<td>The little town of Garrapatta was blessed with many advantages, but stability wasn’t one of them.<br/>For nearly six centuries now it had clung to the black mountain above Cape San Martin, with varying degrees of success. Every so often it lost its grip, for one reason or another; either the winter storms would precipitate a slide or the San Andreas Fault would shrug, and greater or lesser portions of Garrapatta would plummet into the sea.<br/>But its handful of citizens were a hardy lot, long accustomed to minor inconveniences like abrupt changes in elevation or rappelling down cliffs to purchase groceries. There were so many reasons to stay there! The breathtaking view of the Pacific, the grandeur and isolation of the coastline, the bubbling springs, the fresh air …<br/>All the same, when the last bad El Niño had relocated the entire business district (five of the town’s eight public buildings had landed in a colony of elephant seals) there was reluctant talk of abandonment. The Protector had come to Garrapatta’s rescue, however.<br/>Yes, Mr. Hearst had kindly evacuated the refugees and provided shelter for them down the coast at San Simeon while he brought in engineers, architects, and the most expensive antigravity technology. Over a period of five years the townsite was stabilized, the road restored, the businesses rebuilt. The citizens of Garrapatta now had every assurance that, regardless of how much the mountain moved in future, antigravity would keep their community exactly where it was. Any problems related to floating in midair could be solved with a few sturdy foot bridges.<br/>The return of the natives was quite a gala event. They were loaded into Mr. Hearst’s own superyacht, provided with box lunches and taken up the coastline to the new boat landing he had built next to the former seal colony. There they disembarked and rode in the new antigravity elevator up to Garrapatta, where a brass band on the deck of the new general store played “Home, Sweet Home.” One of Mr. Hearst’s public relations people (he seldom appeared in public himself) then provided the townsfolk with a guided tour of the civic improvements.<br/>Every least shack and vegetable patch had been faithfully restored, the general store was more spacious, the Vertical Café had lost none of its crusty charm, and the Garrapatta Springs Hotel had plumbing and new towels in case they ever had guests. Nor was this all: Mr. Hearst had even provided Garrapatta with a ninth structure, the Phoebe Apperson Hearst Memorial Cultural Center.<br/>This was a great improvement on the old Garrapatta Cultural Center, which had been housed in the hotel lobby and consisted of three holoes and a broken holoprojector. The new cultural center loomed grandly above the town, a building of reinforced concrete dug well into the mountain, with an ornate façade in Spanish Renaissance style. Within was stored a library of over a million entries in holo entertainment, games, music, and even literature, though the only one of Garrapatta’s citizens who could read was the cultural center’s new curator, Joseph X. Machina. Smiling and urbane, he shook hands with his new neighbors and hoped they’d all attend the Saturday night film fests he was planning.<br/>The brass band went home, the public relations person went home, and life returned to what passed for normal in Garrapatta.</td>

The fighting will be over quickly.”<br/>“This could work,” said Joseph in awe. “Won’t we need thongs, though?

His rooms were crowded now with stacked crates, and if a Public Health Monitor were to burst in for an inspection at that particular moment, Victor would have a great deal of explaining to do.<br/>What was in all those stacked crates? Dangerous and immoral contraband, though once it would have been described as Christmas cheer or gourmet delicacies, garnered patiently from Third World sovereignties over a period of two years. There were bottles of old port, dark as blood, in those crates, there were bottles of the most costly champagnes. Liqueurs. Pate full of truffles, tiny containers of caviar. Obscure herbs and spices, wonderfully potent. Pickled oysters and the pickled eggs of wild birds, honey garnered from opium poppies, jars of clotted cream. If it was rich, if it was delicious, if it was bad for a mortal to consume, it was probably in those crates.<br/>The immorality didn’t stop there. No, it went far beyond: for in a distant refrigeration locker, far above the sunny streets of Avalon, hung slaughtered and butchered animals, rotting on the hook to suitable tenderness for consumption. No Public Health Monitor could deal with this. He or she would be on his or her knees puking in the abattoir at the merest glance at all the bones and veins and muscles and slow-dripping nastiness … but to set aside the twenty-fourth century point of view for a moment, Victor had really bagged a lot of prime meat. Pheasants and grouse, a peacock, a wild boar, a sea turtle, a suckling pig and a calf, venison, and finally that ultimate martyr to humanity’s wickedness: a buffalo.

Quint worked beside me all that time, I trusted him, and then—why, he did just what you said he’d do.” He poked the dish of chocolates uneasily</td>

In museums, in gardens, in ancient libraries, they appeared for the last solitary watch.<br/>In London, nobody seemed to notice the woman who had retreated into a high gallery at the Globe Theatre and was staring at the empty stage, watching shadows strut and posture.<br/>In China, there was a whole party of silent folk on the Great Wall, looking out to the north, as though phantom armies massed there.<br/>In Prague a well-dressed man sat quietly at a café table in the old square. He ordered tea, and watched the mortal carnival for hours, and when the great Clock struck and its mechanical Death nodded, he nodded back.<br/>In Iraq a woman knelt in the ruins of Babylon the Great and wept awhile, and at last settled herself to wait at the base of a broken statue of Ishtar.<br/>What were you expecting they’d do?<br/>Rise in rebellion, as in a nice testosterone-loaded science fiction novel, laser pistols blazing away in both fists?</td>

<td>He wore a loincloth of jaguar skin, a shivering sunburst of feathers that radiated a full meter out from his head, and golden bells that rang as he stamped out the Dance of the Cycle of Days. Jade beads clicked out the rhythm against his chest, in the long passage of the dance where the drums fell silent. The audience watched, rapt, waiting for a misstep that never happened, though sweat fell from his body like rain; every step perfect, balanced, effortless. While he danced, it was possible to believe he held the universe together, and would dance forever.<br/>He was Agustin Aguilar, twenty-two years old, Flatley Scholarship winner, principal dancer with Ballet Folklorico de Veracruz. It was the eve of his wedding.<br/>For that reason he left the party after the show early, programmed his car for Acapulco, and cranked back his seat so he could get some sleep on the long drive. The city lights fell behind. For a while there were stars; they slipped gradually under a wall of black cloud, but by then Agustin was sleeping and didn’t see the red flash of lightning, miles ahead in the mountains to the west.<br/>It was hours before the strike came. It jolted him awake when it hit, a flare of light brighter than the sun, and the afterimage as all the instruments on the console burned out. Then, a drop and an impact that rattled his teeth, a prolonged scream of metal, a fan of sparks thrown up to either side; the car’s ag drive had cut out and it had fallen to the road, was hurtling forward across asphalt, slewing to one side as it came. Off the edge of the road it went, into a ditch, with a sickening jar.<br/>Agustin could see nothing but pitch blackness for a moment. A light approached, diffused through the dust cloud he’d raised. He threw off his shock enough to shout, to pound on the transparent canopy, to grope for the emergency release lever. The canopy was jammed, but someone was outside now, yanking on it, a black silhouette backlit by headlights through the roiling dust. The canopy was wrenched away with a shriek and someone was hauling him out bodily. Agustin was set on his feet, shivering in the night air. “Are you all right, man?” shouted his rescuer.<br/>“I think so,” said Agustin through chattering teeth, staring at the stranger. An</td>

He seemed a little older than Agustin, had a lean somber face and Indian cheekbones, a black gaze like a flint knife.<br/>“My God,” said the stranger. “Struck by lightning! Your car’s fried, my friend.” He pointed down at the hood where paint had bubbled away to bare steel at the edges of the black hole, out of which white smoke and floating ash streamed upward.<br/>“My tuxedo—” Agustin started forward, but the man stopped him like a stone wall.<br/>“I’ll get it,” he said brusquely, and a second later was handing Agustin his suitcase and garment bag. “Come on, my son, let’s get you to Acapulco.”<br/>Agustin was grateful for the warmth of the stranger’s truck, for the hot soup from the stranger’s thermjar, for the use of the stranger’s Shisha to notify the car rental agency, for every kilometer that took him away from the wreck and closer to Marisol.<br/>“So, what’s the tuxedo for?” said the stranger. His face was spookily lit by the green console lights.<br/>“I’m getting married tomorrow,” said Agustin. “Today, I guess. The ninth. I have a lot to thank you for, Mr …?”<br/>“Aguilar,” said the other. “Porfirio Aguilar.”<br/>“I’m Agustin Aguilar! Do you think we might be related?”<br/>“Maybe,” said Porfirio.

Authority, confidence, wisdom; and, tonight, a certain gaiety, glittering in hard eyes. An excitement edged with just the slightest… unease?<br/>Not these elegant folk uneasy, surely, not these gentlemen and ladies in evening dress. It was true that they were very nearly at the end of recorded time, but every one of them had seen epochs roll by, had survived horrors and splendors beyond mortal comprehension.<br/>For example, Facilitator General Kiu—stepping lightly from the limousine, accepting Labienus’s proffered arm with a gracious smile—once clung desperately to the arm of the marauder bearing her on his horse from the flaming ruin of her village, in a world so long past the most determined archaeologist might seek for a trace of it in vain. She had seduced kings and ministers in her time, she had watched impassive as Troy fell. Nothing to frighten her in a little Armageddon.</td>

<td>Nennius wasn’t worried either, gallantly fetching out her silk wrap for Facilitator Ashoreth. Nothing had been able to terrify him since he had watched the other tribe confronting his parents’ timid little migrating party, challenging their right to cross a long-drowned causeway from one continent to an adjacent one. He had cried and cowered when the stone-tipped spears began to fly, hidden his face until the screaming stopped and he’d looked up into the pale eyes of the bearded giant. Why are you weeping, mortal child? his rescuer had said. This is the way of the world. He had built his immortal life on that wisdom.<br/>So had Gamaliel, though he had heard it from a very different person: stern-eyed Facilitator Amaunet, leaning down like a living shadow through shattered clay-and-stick walls to lift him from his dying mother’s arms. This is the way of the world, Amaunet had advised him, and then she had added: Look at the slaughter, mortal child. This is mortal evil. Gamaliel had never forgotten, even to this late hour when he was adjusting his tie and nodding to her over the roof of their limousine.<br/>And he had passed the wisdom on in his turn, when he had lifted the child who would be Aegeus from the smashed cart and showed him the whooping thieves playing ball with the head of the boy’s father. This is mortal evil, he had told the child. This is what the monkeys do. Never forget it.<br/>Nor had Aegeus ever forgotten, though he had built walls of graciousness around himself to contain the ugly truth, kept it locked away as though in a reliquary of gold and rock crystal, meant to hold something precious. Indeed, the truth was precious, and he had carefully gifted young Moreham with it, when he had found the child shivering, trying to warm himself at the ashes where bones smoldered. Aegeus had taken him up and set him before him in the saddle, and pointed out across all that the legions had left of Isurium. Never forget this, he had instructed. Never forgive them.<br/>There were indeed certain ideological differences among the immortals arriving for dinner. Certain heads were eagerly anticipating seeing certain other heads roll, so abiding was their mutual hatred. Yet all of them shared one common bond, in their profound loathing and contempt for mortal humanity. They had never forgotten. They would never forgive.<br/></td>

No more than three ever came around the same side of the table at any one time, however, so as they moved off to busy themselves with bringing in the fish course everyone relaxed.<br/>Not so far that each dish wasn’t thoroughly scanned as it was set before them. But no trace of anything toxic was found; not in the poached salmon in mousseline sauce, nor the oysters, nor the braised sea turtle. Therefore, light and sparkling conversation accompanied the second course, with the appropriate white wines.<br/>It was dinner conversation of the highest caliber, too, refined to an art at tables in old Byzantium, in Pompeii and Amarna and Angkor Wat, polished in every beautiful doomed place that had ever spread its cloth for a pale horseman.

For, even as Nicholas and Mendoza stare, the pile is altering: shifting, condensing, settling, as though alive with tiny moving things—which, in fact, it is. The effect just misses being unspeakably horrible, by virtue of the fact that the body is not decomposing but taking form.<br/>“I thought the pumpkin was a particularly nice touch,” says Edward, framing it with his hands. “Rather classical, don’t you think?”<br/>“I just redesigned a few nanobots like I said, and let ‘em multiply, and eyedroppered ‘em on, and they went crazy,” says Alec proudly. “Look how fast it’s going.”<br/>And indeed it is going quickly.

Nicholas raised his eyes to the gargantuan columns, the pulsing lights. Had Mendoza, and all the others like her, suffered over so many years for this thing?

Always easier to destroy something than to create something. It’s harder to plant a garden than to blow up a building, and undoubtedly more boring, but you just might need to do it one day, eh?<br/>Nicholas bowed his head.

Then he looked back at her slave. Leaning down, he took the slave’s hand in his own and gripped it firmly. “A-ah!” cried the slave, as something seemed to flow down his arm from the man’s arm, and then he arched his back and gasped and shuddered.

Exhilarated as she was to be having an adventure at last, she was still weakened and half blinded by the blazing sun as it rose.

Or there might be cannibals, or pirates.” She looked fearfully out at the big boat.<br/>“I really don’t think—” he began, but was interrupted by her shrill cry. She had just turned around and looked into the interior of the island, and seen to her astonishment that the lawn where they lay was only the edge of a vast and beautifully tended garden. It was bright with flowers, it was shaded by trees heavy with fruit, and there were pergolas and balustraded stairs leading somewhere, but Tiara didn’t notice where, exactly; for standing not a stone’s throw away on the green lawn were a big man and a woman. They were staring at Tiara and her slave, in astonishment no less great than her own.<br/>They walked forward. Tiara cringed above her slave to protect him, blinking desperately in the brightness, trying to see them clearly. “What is it?” The slave turned his head this way and that.<br/>“Oh please,” Tiara whimpered. They kept coming, and she glanced sidelong at the woman and turned to peer at the man, but she had to crane her head back to look, he was so tall, he went up and up against the green trees—<br/>Her mouth fell open, and then her little face was radiant with joy and relief. “Oh, it’s you,” she said. “Oh, we’re saved!

Joseph had gone very pale. “What is that?” Suleyman inquired, knowing in that moment that he had lost.<br/>“A launching device.” Budu chuckled. “To summon a guided missile. Not a very big one, but powerful. It ought to take out this mountain.”<br/>“Oh dear God,” said Hearst. Someone among the mortals screamed, a weak sound that trailed away into hysterical sobbing.<br/>“Where did you get a missile, father?” said Joseph in a ghost of a voice.<br/>“I built one,” Budu told him. “While you slept.”<br/>“Oh.”<br/>Budu was still holding Suleyman’s gaze with his own.

If the rest of you won’t listen to me, you can go where he went. Okay?”<br/>“Why should we obey you?” Budu asked.<br/>“Because I’m, er, omnipotent,” said Alec.<br/>“Really?” Budu said. “What will you do if I fire the missile?” he said, placing his thumb on the button.

He and Mendoza take tea on the terrace every epoch/evening, and wait for their—sons? Other selves? Other halves? Whatever the hell the relationship is—to come home from work. Just like any other family. Almost.<br/>And speaking of families: it was agreed that no more immortals would be made, ever. No more stealing mortal children and putting them through years of surgery and programming. But when it was discovered that Edward and Mendoza had figured out a way to have babies … what a surprise! It turned out there were a lot of immortal women, and no few men for that matter, who had secretly longed for the chance to have kids of their own all these years.<br/>I thought it was a really dumb idea, but despite my—choke—family relationship with the holy trinity, my opinion doesn’t carry a lot of weight. Edward feels that proper parenting skills are important, in fact indispensable to immortals, that if we’d had a chance to develop them there wouldn’t have been creeps like Labienus and Aegeus.<br/>So anyone applying to Captain Morgan (how’d you like to have him for your OB-GYN?) gets advice, assistance with producing embryos from DNA and implantation, and—oh yeah—a great big autographed copy of Child Care in the Cyborg Family, all nine million volumes of it. Kids that come with a manual, no less. Latif and Sarai have had a child. Kalugin and Nan are having one, too.

Her letters and journals indicate that she suffered both emotionally and physically, before and after the birth: “Dream that my little baby came to life again-that it had only been cold &amp; that we rubbed it by the fire &amp; it lived—I... awake &amp; find no baby-I think about the little thing all day-not in good spirits,” she wrote in her journal on March 19.

<td>The vital thing is to ensure the right mixture of seeds for procreation, coarse harmonizing with fine and fine with coarse. Another important factor is diet: some foods thicken the seeds in the body, others in turn thin and diminish them. A third factor of great importance is the mode in which the pleasures of intercourse are enjoyed. It is thought that women conceive more readily in the manner of four-footed beasts in a prone posture with loins uplifted so as to give access to the seed. Certainly, wives have no need of lascivious movements. A woman makes conception more difficult by offering a mock resistance and accepting Venus with a wriggling body. She diverts the furrow from the straight course of the ploughshare and makes the seed fall wide of the plot. These tricks are employed by prostitutes for their own ends, so that they may not conceive too frequently and be laid up by pregnancy and at the same time may make intercourse more attractive to men. But obviously our wives can have no use for them.</td>

Though the object of your love may be absent, images of it still haunt you and the beloved name chimes sweetly in your ears. If you find yourself thus passionately enamoured of an individual, you should keep well away from such images. Thrust from you anything that might feed your passion, and turn your mind elsewhere. Vent the seed of love upon other objects. By clinging to it you assure yourself the certainty of heart-sickness and pain. With nourishment the festering sore quickens and strengthens. Day by day the frenzy heightens and the grief deepens. Your only remedy is to lance the first wound with new incisions; to salve it, while it is still fresh, with promiscuous attachments; to guide the motions of your mind into some other channel.</td>

They would never reflect on their youth, because they knew nothing else, and by the time they died, if they even did, their portraits would be long rotted away to nothing.<br/> Gadfly appeared to be a man in his middle thirties. Like every example of his kind he was tall, slim, and beautiful. His eyes were the clear crystal blue of the sky after rain has washed away the summer heat, his complexion as pale and flawless as porcelain, and his hair the radiant silver-gold of dew illuminated by a sunrise. I know it sounds ridiculous, but fair folk require such comparisons. There’s simply no other way to describe them. Once, a Whimsical poet died of despair after finding himself unequal to the task of capturing a fair one’s beauty in simile. I think it more likely he died of arsenic poisoning, but so the story goes.<br/> You must keep in mind, of course, that all of this is only a glamour, not what they really look like underneath.<br/> Fair folk are talented dissemblers, but they can’t lie outright. Their glamour always has a flaw. Gadfly’s flaw was his fingers; they were far too long to be human and sometimes appeared oddly jointed. If someone looked at his hands too long he would lace them together or scurry them under a napkin like a pair of spiders to put them out of sight. He was the most personable fair one I knew, far more relaxed about manners than the rest of them, but staring was never a good idea—unless, like me, you had a good reason to.<br/> Finally, Gadfly ate the cake.

Even if lacking religious or aesthetic activities, at least each village provided endless opportunities for gossip and discussion; under the largest tree of the square, men not otherwise occupied sat smoking their pipes or chewing mildly hallucinogenic leaves and nuts, and kept their minds ordered through redundant conversation.

Of course this does not mean that these functions need to be the only purpose of sex. For example, the adaptive function of taste buds was to distinguish between wholesome and spoiled food, but with time we developed complex culinary arts based on subtle nuances of taste. So also whatever were the original reasons for sexual pleasure, it can always be used to yield new possibilities for enriching life. But just as gluttony that has no relationship to hunger seems unnatural, an obsession with sex that is divorced from other human needs such as intimacy, caring, and commitment becomes equally aberrant.</td>

<td>Well?” he asked, trying unsuccessfully to sound bored. “What did you find?” Eli tightened his grip on the steering wheel as he drove toward Lockland. “Trauma.” “What about it?” “It was the only commonality I could find in all the cases of EOs that are even close to well-documented. Anyway, bodies react in strange ways under stress. Adrenaline and all that, as you know. I figured that trauma could cause the body to chemically alter.” He began to speak faster. “But the problem is, trauma is such a vague word, right? It’s a whole blanket, really, and I needed to isolate a thread. Millions of people are traumatized daily. Emotionally, physically, what-have-you. If even a fraction of them became ExtraOrdinary, they would compose a measurable percentage of the human population. And if that were the case EOs would be more than a thing in quotation marks, more than a hypothesis; they’d be an actuality. I knew there had to be something more specific.” “A genre of trauma? Like car accidents?” asked Victor. “Yes, exactly, except there weren’t indicators of any common trauma. No obvious formula. No parameters. Not at first.” Eli let his words hang in the car. Victor turned the radio from low to off. Eli was practically bouncing in his seat. “But?” prompted Victor, cringing at his own obvious interest. “But I started digging,” said Eli, “and the few case studies I could dig up—unofficial ones, of course, and this shit was a pain to find—the people in them weren’t just traumatized, Vic. They died. I didn’t see it at first because nine times out of ten when a person doesn’t stay dead, it isn’t even recorded as an NDE. Hell, half the time people don’t realize they’ve had an NDE.” “NDE?” Eli glanced over at Victor. “Near death experience. What if an EO isn’t a product of just any trauma? What if their bodies are reacting to the greatest physical and psychological trauma possible? Death. Think about it, the kind of transformation we’re talking about wouldn’t be possible with a physiological reaction alone, or a psychological reaction alone. It would require a huge influx of adrenaline, of fear, awareness. We talk about the power of will, we talk about mind over matter, but it’s not one over the other, it’s both at once. The mind and the body both respond to imminent death, and in those cases where both are strong enough—and both would have to be strong, I’m talking about genetic predisposition and will to survive—I think you might have a recipe for an EO.” Victor’s mind whirred as he listened to Eli’s theory. He flexed his fingers against his pant legs. It made sense. It made sense and it was simple and elegant and Victor hated that, especially because he should have seen it first, should have been able to hypothesize. Adrenaline was his research topic. The only difference was that he’d been studying temporary flux, and Eli had gone so far as to suggest a permanent shift. Anger flared through him, but anger was unproductive so he twisted it into pragmatism while he searched for a flaw. “</td>

But he had Eli’s attention. He liked having his attention. “Who knows how many factors? But I’m willing to admit that the body is capable of incredible things in life-threatening situations. That’s what my thesis has been about, remember? And maybe you’re right. Maybe the body is even capable of a fundamental chemical shift. Adrenaline has given people seemingly superhuman abilities in times of dire need. Glimpses of power. Perhaps there’s a way to make the change a lasting one.</td>

When the South seceded in 1945, all environmental regulations had been lifted on the biblical grounds of men having “dominion over the earth,” but by the mid-1970s three decades of an unbroken hunting season and heedless pollution had nearly eradicated wild game and forage. Drought, crop failure, and a strict trade embargo meant the families who best survived those years had ways of catching the rats, squirrels, and feral cats. But X never responded to the critique that her work seemed to be apolitical for never directly referencing the country’s division; nearly every other successful artist in the Northern Territory at the time seemed obliged at some point to make work as a statement about the wall, and the fact that X never did so was often cited as evidence of her heartlessness and frivolity.</td>

<td>The first winter she was dead it seemed every day for months on end was damp and bright—it had always just rained, but I could never remember the rain—and I took the train down to the city a few days a week, searching (it seemed) for a building I might enter and fall from, a task about which I could never quite determine my own sincerity, as it seemed to me the seriousness of anyone looking for such a thing could not be understood until a body needed to be scraped from the sidewalk. With all the recent attacks, of course, security had tightened everywhere, and you had to have permission or an invitation to enter any building, and I never had such things, as I was no one in particular, uncalled for. One and a half people kill themselves in the city each day, and I looked for them—the one person or the half person—but I never saw the one and I never saw the half, no matter how much I looked and waited, patiently, so patiently, and after some time I wondered if I could not find them because I was one of them, either the one or the half.<br/> </td>

I don’t have a particular feeling that I want to shock anyone. On the contrary, when I was following Sophie around I was very afraid that it would be a cruel thing to do. That was, until I realized that it was only provocative to other people, not to Sophie herself. In some ways I thought her entire body of work up to that point had been a request for someone to follow her like this. And so I did. I feel sure she enjoyed it. I’ve never spoken to her, though. I suppose we’ve said everything to each other that there is to say.</td>

<td>It seemed that names had been given to and taken from me all my life, for reasons beyond my control. My parents had been in disagreement about what to write on my birth certificate, one of them insisting on Charlotte Marie and the other on Cynthia Malone. Until the age of seven I was called both names interchangeably, and when asked as a child what my name was, I gave both in a row: Charlotte Marie Lucca and Cynthia Malone Lucca. A few times this resulted in someone calling me Ann after they’d misheard the “and,” so for a year at Girl Scouts I was Ann. What’s more—my last name is my mother’s pure invention, her attempt to get away from her own family, whose last name I have never known, but my father won the first-name argument in the end, and Charlotte Marie was made my legal name, though my mother still called me Cindy and both my brothers called me Malone, Mally, or Loner. Since there were too many Charlottes in my third-grade class, a teacher started calling me Marie and that stuck for a while and I didn’t mind. In college I was Charlotte again, by default of roll call, but some people in journalism school called me Lucca—as most of us had adopted the newsroom affectation of calling people by their surnames. When I began publishing I used C. M. Lucca, and though I’d only intended for “C. M.” to appear in print, most of my colleagues started calling me C. M. Henry had the bizarre habit of calling me Char, which wasn’t a name at all but something you do to a piece of dead flesh, but I accepted this name, too, for no reason other than I had no preferred alternative. X didn’t call me anything at first, or if she did I don’t remember what she called me—“Henry Surner’s wife,” perhaps, as a joke—so when Ginny began to call me C and X followed suit, it ultimately felt fine, as it seems I was born under a nameless moon and perhaps that namelessness was what X had been drawn to from the start: I was a house without a foundation.</td>

<td> was April 1977, and the boy at the front desk came in and said there was someone important in the gallery, but he said he didn’t know who it was. Of course, I always had my boys memorize photographs of the major critics and curators, but this was truly hilarious, I thought—how was this kid to know, by sight alone, whether someone was important? I can’t say why I even entertained the notion, but I went out to the gallery and there she was, wearing this loose silk dress that went to the floor, some kind of circular pattern, but it was the way she was looking at the work—with a complete viciousness. I don’t know how else to explain it, as if it would be dangerous for her to look at you.<br/> “Was she enjoying the paintings, I asked, and she said, ‘Oh, no, not at all.’ She didn’t even turn to see where the question had come from. I asked if she was a collector, or an artist herself, or…? But she didn’t answer, just paced around … Eventually, she asked if I was the one to blame for these paintings. I told her that I was indeed the gallerist here, and she turned to me for the first time and said, ‘I’m so sorry to hear that,’ then launched into this explanation about how terrible the work was, how the artist had no understanding of color or dimensionality or texture, that he was indulgent, that he had no ideas, that the paintings documented his every missed opportunity. She said—‘He didn’t put anything in the paintings because he doesn’t know how. He doesn’t know anything about art, and worse, he doesn’t care.’ Now, of course I was accustomed to criticism—I even welcomed it on occasion—but no one’s opinion ever made me as doubtful as hers. Ah! Then she said this one thing I’ve thought of many times since—‘You have to know what you’re leaving out in order for it not to be there. Otherwise, it’s not an absence, it’s just nothing.’ And immediately I had a better understanding of all those void artists back then—there were so many of them. Anyway, I sent the desk boy home early, and eventually this woman said her name was Věra, and I asked her how it was she’d come to her opinions about art. ‘Oh, they’re not opinions,</td>

X chose the latter, to proceed as if there had been no Connie at all rather than reckon with a love that was impossible to resolve or fold away neatly. It is better to cut than to tear, she sometimes advised.

It is true that in the years we lived together X never needed to consult an instruction manual, and seemed to know innately how to operate any machine—the VCR, the security system, the dishwasher. After buying an old truck, she spent a half hour speed-reading an auto mechanics textbook, and from then on she took care of all the truck’s maintenance. The few times I ever complimented or even commented upon the speed with which X could absorb a new skill, she insisted—not out of humility, but in frustration—that there was nothing to it. Other people, it seemed to her, were simply too indolent to teach themselves anything, and though it seemed this accusation included me—as I never repaired the car or installed heavy machinery or even attempted to operate our clock radio—I chose not to press her on this point.</td>

Absolutely hated it, she said, then went on and on about how pathetic his work was in general. In five minutes she’d described the entire sweep of art history, from the ancient to the contemporary, and by the end of it I had this knot in my stomach. It was far too late to cancel the show, and collectors were already lining up, but she had seen straight through the whole thing. When she was done she left immediately, as if she was too disgusted to stay another moment. Later I asked the ash guy if he’d ever heard of someone named Věra, but he said he hadn’t. A few weeks later she stopped by again, sneering and laughing at the pile of ash, but this time I convinced her to come with me to a bar around the corner—I was still trying to figure out who she was, of course, but also I couldn’t stand to be in the room with that pile of ash after she’d embarrassed me so much over it.<br/> “I’d never met anyone in New York less willing to talk about herself—still haven’t—but after a few glasses of wine that afternoon I finally got some details from her—that she was an artist, but she’d only exhibited abroad, that she didn’t respect any New York galleries, and I found myself almost begging her to show me her work—mind you, I’d never begged anyone for anything, and certainly not an artist, as they were constantly presenting their own severed heads on a platter at my feet, desperate for my attention, but that was the thing about her—she may have been a con artist, but the con was always honest.”<br/> That evening X, known in that moment as “Věra,” agreed to accompany Ginny to a few openings, and while X’s refusal to show Ginny any of her own work may have seemed like a tactic to string along her interest, in truth X had no work to show. “It was at least a year before she agreed to let me see anything, long after I’d stopped asking,” Ginny said.<br/> The first pieces that Věra exhibited with Quarry, in early 1979, were allegedly documentations of performances she’d done in years prior, but in fact X had only produced all this “performance documentation” months after she inserted herself into Ginny’s world, a simple fact Ginny Green refuses to accept.<br/> “I understand that Věra was a pseudonym, a made-up person, but the work was simply the work.

<td>Humans move magic by reaching out with the innermost part of ourselves. Officially, that’s the mana-connecting prehensile self-perspective appendage, but it’s better known by its colloquial name, the soul. Human souls are what give us our unique ability to move and process magic outside of ourselves, both the ambient stuff that rises naturally from the ground and power contained in other vessels, including spirits and other living creatures. The ability to do this consciously and deliberately is what makes a person a mage, but all humans’ souls move magic to some degree whether they’re mages or not. As with any appendage, though, the soul can be damaged by overuse, resulting in a sprain or a tear.</td>

That’s what HBO wants, to bet on that sort of commitment and passion”—the sort that inspires an obsessive-compulsive approach to adapting a fantasy epic for a network that doesn’t do fantasy. “Whatever reservations I had, they were gone. I thought, ‘These guys aren’t swinging for the easy hit. They’re doing this because they love these stories.’” In January 2007, Lombardo and HBO optioned the series. Eight years later, Game of Thrones knocked off The Sopranos to become HBO’s most watched show of all time.</td>

Customers have requested designs for a wide range of subjects, but even if I like the topic, there are a lot of clever people out there and most of the low-hanging fruit has been picked.

The answer involves a mix of policy, history, and the magnetizing effect of talent. First, the Swedish government actively promotes public music education at a time when many countries have no such policy (“I have public music education to thank for everything,” Martin said in 2001). Second, Sweden has a musical culture that promotes major-chord melodies over lyrics, which makes their songs highly exportable to audiences who don’t speak Swedish.<br/></td>

It turns the influencer question on its head. Don’t ask, “Who is powerful?” Instead ask, “Who is vulnerable?” In Duncan Watts’s computer models, global cascades happen when a trigger hits a densely connected audience clustered around a commonality, a soft cult. Whitney Wolfe discovered the same. “I often ask my team if they’d rather advertise on a New York City taxi or with a sticker on a backpack,” she said. “The NYC taxi cab will be seen by thousands of people, and the backpack sticker might only create curiosity among a handful.” But Wolfe, like Vincent Forrest, prefers the smaller emblem of identity, a jumping-off point for a conversation between friends. “When I’m doing my job well,” Forrest told me, “I’m saying something precise that is specific enough that it feels personal and relatable to others with the same interests.</td>

Not just pretty, beautiful, almost shockingly so. Her face, a perfect oval, had the coveted high cheekbones and the small yet full mouth. Her nose suggested a touch of something exotic, its lines straight but slightly unusual for Adrianglia, and her eyes reinforced it. Large, wide, yet lightly elongated at the inner corners, they hinted at some mystery, some uncommon heritage and the promise of a dangerous edge. She wasn’t just stunning, she looked interesting, which was infinitely more important than classic perfection or beauty.

Each morning, the artist and his assistants prepared an area that would need to be fully painted at day’s end, when the fresh application of plaster dried. The result would be a giornata—Italian for “day’s work”—and the ceiling is really a mosaic of these small, irregularly shaped accomplishments with barely perceptible borders. Adam, reclining, is four giornate. God, outstretching, another four. Making a count, we can see that Michelangelo spent some five hundred and seventy days at that altitude with his trowels, brushes, pots of paint, and bags of sand and lime.</td>

This was 1994, a Tuesday. On the Friday, my bank paid to have me flown to a hospital in Paris where my guts were put back together and where I spent four months recovering. I secured a tourist visa to America. As soon as I arrived I applied for and was fairly quickly granted asylum. My first job in New York paid four dollars and twenty-five cents an hour. My first job as a security guard paid five-something.

I was laid off following a merger and then the Great Recession hit. I bought a check cashing place in a rough neighborhood, but I proved to be neither tough enough nor nasty enough for that business. I lost my shirt. I lost all my life savings. It’s okay, though. It’s okay.” He shrugs at my astonished concern. “Really, it’s okay. I have my life, my family, my integrity. If today I met those men who murdered me, I’d shake their hands. Why not?

Together we look at a face that is placid and impassive but not fixed or frozen—a supple, blood-in-the-cheeks vision of what the goddess of wisdom looked like, her beauty all sturdiness and strength. “Athena was the goddess of a special kind of wisdom,” I tell them. “Have you read the Odyssey? You have—perfect. In the Odyssey, Athena shows up every time Odysseus needs a jolt of confidence and inspiration. You know the feeling…. You’re stumbling around feeling blah and out of nowhere your mood lightens and you have the energy and courage and clarity required to do something that felt impossible moments before. Today we would think that the change came from inside us, but the Greeks didn’t believe that. For them, all forces originated in the external world, forces that were powerful and unpredictable and grabbed hold of people’s emotions just like it controlled their fates. Athena was sometimes called the goddess of nearness because of the way she could penetrate and transform minds”—I gesture to the face—“for the better, wouldn’t you say? Look at her awhile.

Apparently, he was one of these museumgoers who chronically slow down their companions, in this case his friend, artist Anton Kerssemakers. “He spent the longest time in front of ‘The Jewish Bride’ ” by Rembrandt, Kerssemakers writes.<br/> <br/> I could not tear him away from the spot; he went and sat down there at his ease, while I myself went on to look at some other things. “You will find me here when you come back,” he told me.<br/> When I came back after a pretty long while and asked him whether we should not get a move on, he gave me a surprised look and said, “Would you believe it—and I honestly mean what I say—I should be happy to give ten years of my life if I could go on sitting here in front of this picture for a fortnight, with only a crust of dry bread for food?” At last he got up. “Well, never mind,” he said, “we can’t stay here forever, can we?”<br/></td>

<td> poetry.<br/> In Ibn ‘Arabi’s conception, humans have two distinct ways of seeing. First, we have a faculty of awareness at the heart of our hearts, a piece of our consciousness fine-tuned to perceive reality, an unmediated ability to apprehend the world’s beauty and sublimity such that the Real (or God) feels near and unconcealed. It is the type of seeing the mihrab inspires in me.<br/> But we also have our logical brains, and they remind us how little we’ve seen of the world and what small means we have of deciphering its ultimate reality (or manifold realities). Looking at the universe this way, its truth seems distant and hidden, and the Real feels incomprehensible. It is the type of seeing the “Simonetti” carpet inspires in me.</td>

<td>Down in the gift shop, they have a highly mathematical book about Islamic design that I’ve spent a couple of my breaks paging through and puzzling over, wishing I could get an assist from Tom. As far as I can make out, designers always began with the circle, the simplest and most primordial shape, which they would subdivide to tease out implied shapes inscribed within. By choosing to erase certain lines and extend and repeat others outward over an infinite grid, they created innumerable patterns that were all derived from the original circle, which in its oneness was emblematic of God. The final product would contain no visible trace of the circle but stood as a demonstration of the unity that underlies multiplicity, a tenet of the Muslim faith.</td>

There’s Kenji, a young man with developmental differences who asks the guards which trains we’re riding home and alerts us to any service advisories, which is very useful. There’s the old man who every day wears a green blazer like Arnold Palmer and gives long-winded advice to any college kid he can waylay. There’s the fellow who looks at pictures with an ivory-handled magnifying glass and dresses a bit like a silent movie star, a long coat hanging on his shoulders. (I regret not knowing his name, but we call each other “Sir.”) And there is Dwight, who is sure to walk the entirety of the museum with his distinctive slow stride, saying hello to every guard he sees exactly once per day (if he sees you a second time, you get nothing). I’ve seldom been able to coax more than two words out of Dwight, who is usually busy writing (or drawing?) on small scraps of paper. But today he says: “Haven’t seen you in a while…” and walks on without waiting for a reply.</td>

<td>IN THE SPRING OF 2017 I flew to Austin, Texas, to cover South by Southwest for Esquire. I was sitting alone in a dark Alamo Drafthouse theater, scribbling notes about a documentary called The Work. In the film, the cameras take you inside Folsom State Prison for intensive group therapy sessions. Men convicted of crimes sit side by side with visitors from the outside who haven’t been sentenced to jail but are dealing with buried issues that are inhibiting their lives. Over the course of four days, both the incarcerated people and the free men push one another to open up about their struggles. Many participants resist. Early on, several of the men judge, scoff, and pay lip service to the whole ordeal. But eventually the dam breaks for everyone. Some of the men go into a blind rage after particular comments from group members prick their suppressed pain. They punch and writhe. Their neck veins pop. One of the visitors, Brian, emits a guttural howl that sounds like the devil is flying out of his chest. But after these bouts of explosive anger and violence come tears. Some men nearly collapse in exhaustion, having finally let this suppressed pain out of their body. In Brian’s case, his face transforms after punching and screaming and crying. It’s an epic expulsion of emotion. It takes multiple incarcerated men to restrain him. When the outburst is over, Brian’s eyes are lighter. He literally looks like a different person.<br/>			 As I sat in the theater watching all of this unfold, I started sobbing. I wept for over an hour, drenching my sleeves and notebook.</td>

Early on I easily exceeded my own, and what I assumed to be others’, expectations about my ability to climb with a severed digit. I loved the feeling of progress. I had enjoyed the problem-solving aspect of climbing for my whole career; now I had a new problem to face. For example, pinch holds were exceptionally difficult, so I compensated by strengthening my shoulders—now, rather than pinching holds, I could place my fingers on the inside of the hold and push outward with great force. The loss of the finger wasn’t as crippling as it might have seemed to outsiders because often on the harder climbs, the holds are too small to grab with all four fingers anyway. I excelled on these smaller holds—the two- or three-finger holds—because that’s all I had on my left hand. I’d always thought of vertical climbing as a kind of dance, while overhanging climbing is more of a wrestling match. Strength is relatively easy to build, and many climbers rely on it to compensate for deficiencies in skill. Due to my injury and my general inclination, I focused more and more on technique.

Jim told me about American prisoners of war and how their attitude affected their ability to survive, how hopeful acceptance was better than blind optimism. He asked me about Kyrgyzstan, how I dealt with the ordeal at the time and later. He seemed curious about everything.<br/>			 He then impressed me by naming each of the major El Cap free climbs I’d done in chronological order from the Saláthe Wall to Golden Gate. He spoke about the flywheel effect, how the first revolutions of it are hard, but once momentum is built the wheel turns more freely. I’d always thought of it in terms of a standard progression, not accounting for the effect one effort had on the other. When I applied Jim’s ideas to my climbs on El Cap, routes that had originally felt nearly impossible to free, what I’d been doing made much more sense.<br/></td>

<td>Mike Donahue was a remarkable man. He shared with my father a love of the mountains and the outdoors. While my dad spread word of the wonders and benefits of climbing with messianic fervor, Mike went about the same mission with a more laid-back approach. If my dad was a warrior then Mike was a poet-philosopher. Their differences can probably be best summarized by this: When assessing the clients they led up mountains, if the group had a get-to-the-top-or-bust vibe, then my dad would lead the group. If they seemed more into the experiential nature of the endeavor and the peak was a bonus, then Mike led them. Mike took a slow and meditative, stop-and-smell-roses kind of approach. It never seemed to bother him that he hadn’t climbed the area’s most iconic wall, the east face of Longs Peak—even though many considered it a “must-do,” in terms of status in the climbing community. As Mike put it, “A great adventure without success is far superior to a climb where everything goes as planned.</td>

<td>Kevin takes a totally different strategy to the cold, dealing with it up front. He slowly climbs the bottom half of the pitch, forcing himself to hold on to the rock until his fingers go completely numb. Then he hangs on the rope and rewarms his hands in his jacket. The freeze-thaw cycle creates a horribly nauseating pain that alpine climbers call the “screaming barfies.” Fortunately, the vasodilation usually lasts for several hours, making it useful for barehanded climbing in frigid temperatures. The pain passes in a few minutes, Kevin lowers to the bottom of the pitch and frees it without any problem.<br/></td>

My breath caught in my throat as I looked at the damage, which was severe, but would have been much worse if the car that had been hit wasn’t so sturdy.

To be honest, I think this ability to feel what other people are feeling is part of what makes me a good nurse, and especially a good hospice nurse.

In fact, only one out of every four hospice nurses makes it beyond five years, from what I’ve heard.<br/>			 Empathy, on the other hand, is the ability to feel for a person and their situation without being personally affected by it. Empathy allows me to be present and compassionate without taking on a situation as my own, and it has allowed me to continue being a good nurse without burning out or engaging in the dark humor that so many people in my profession do, for their own sanity.

It felt like a new world out there, his city freshly bathed in freezing water.<br/>			 Inside, he felt as clean as the pure, white snow outside the window. It was almost as if he could feel his own health rising up and filling his body. He had suffered some of the most difficult months of his life. Pain, both physically and emotionally, had consumed him. But now, standing at the window, he felt what he would describe as a “moment of clarity.” He wasn’t quite ready to let the drugs go completely; that would come a month later, at Christmas. But this was a defining moment. A spiritual moment.<br/>			 He looked out the window, lightly touching his forehead to the cold glass. Many patients in his position would have been preparing to die, but not Christian. He opened the window and let the freezing cold air rush in.

The hospital paid $1,000 for that one month of medication. Even worse were the side effects. I spent the whole month sick to my stomach, constantly vomiting. The medication made me tired. I didn’t feel like myself at all. That whole month, while I complained about the effects of an accident I had created, I kept thinking about the many people who take these drugs every day. Not for a month but forever. Not everyone gets sick from the antiviral drugs, but many do. There are those out there who have trouble not just with the side effects but also finding a drug combination that will bring their virus under control. Even worse are the millions who are infected but have no access to the lifesaving drugs I complained about having to take.

The antibody is captured on the hook and a brilliant purple dye on the other end of the fishing pole is released. The well turns purple. The darker the color, the stronger the immune system response.

<td>	 HIV is the retrovirus they identified. It is a kind of viral Trojan horse. It is “retro” because it reproduces itself in a way that’s backward from how most life-forms manage this wonderful trick. In the nucleus of each cell in our body, and we have an awful lot of them, the genetic recipe for building our entire body can be found. Every cell has the complete list of instructions. Those genes are packed in DNA, tightly coiled molecules of nucleic acids. To make use of all the instructions in our genes, certain enzymes unwind the DNA helix in the cell’s nucleus. But to ensure that the precious DNA is not lost, another enzyme swoops in and makes a copy of the DNA needed. This is called transcription. This copy is made literally backward and has a few special alterations. (One of these alterations is to a base called uracil, a molecule whose origin may be extraterrestrial—yes, really.) The copy is called ribonucleic acid, or RNA. The RNA blueprint is then transported from the nucleus to a ribosome, which, once it gets its hands on the RNA, translates the backward code and makes proteins from the blueprint.<br/>			 DNA  RNA  Protein <br/>			 Simple as one, two, three. For decades, this definition of the process, made by Francis Crick, the codiscoverer of DNA with James Watson, was considered scientific dogma. That is how life works. So imagine how surprising it was when scientists discovered that a virus could run in the opposite direction. Retroviruses forced scientists to question what defines life. Here was an organism with a genetic code of its own but with no cell to house it. Can you be alive if you hold the blueprint to life but have to borrow the construction plant from another organism? Can there be life outside a cell? Taxonomists have spent decades debating this, perhaps pointlessly. As Carl Zimmer argues in A Planet of Viruses, “Trying to find a moment in time when such RNA-life abruptly became ‘alive’ just distracts us from the gradual transition to life as we know it.”<br/>			 This is what retroviruses do. They trick our cells into making the proteins they need, as directed from their RNA. Instead of starting with DNA, HIV holds all its genetic information as RNA. The virus exists as two simple strands of RNA packaged into a spiky protein shell containing all the enzymes it needs. The viral RNA</td>

<td>A perfectly planned experiment faced with the chaos of reality often collapses. But, with persistence and experience, some will succeed. Part of maturing as a scientist is recognizing these moments, understanding when to pack it in and when to keep going. Walker, at the very beginning of his career, wasn’t sure which to do. Morose, he sat looking over the botched data. Joe Sodroski, the researcher he wasn’t supposed to disturb, came up to him. “What are you working on?” Sodroski asked, concerned about Walker’s despondent attitude. Walker told Sodroski what he was trying to do and how nothing was working. Much to his surprise, Sodroski had the solution.<br/>			 Using Sodroski’s suggestions, Walker was able to get a unique model for HIV up and running. From their conversation, he devised an artificial system in which B cells taken from patients are engineered to express individual parts of HIV. He then measured the ability of killer T cells, the storm troopers, to respond specifically to each piece. With this scheme, he was able to dissect the components of the T cell response to the virus, teasing out which parts of HIV initiate a response. Taking the storm trooper cells from their first HIV patient, Walker’s team was excited to finally measure how the body responded to HIV. What they found was dramatic. In people infected with HIV, their storm trooper T cells specifically target and kill HIV-infected cells. These killer cells knew who or what they were looking for. When storm trooper cells were taken from people not infected with the HIV virus, the cells did not know what they were looking for. This data was the first indication that the body can mount a specific response to HIV.<br/>			 Walker’s advisor knew this would be a big paper.</td>

They are there for all their patients’ firsts; they may know their patients’ habits and quirks. They know if their patients can handle both the responsibilities and consequences of experimental drugs. Unfortunately, family doctors are in short supply.

One of the younger greenteeth taught her, a swollen-bodied, spindly-limbed sprite called Duckwight. Duckwight was hideous and her teeth were the color of moss, but she was as patient as water flowing over stone.They practiced for weeks, holding hands. They stood up, they squatted down, over and over, with Duckwight’s magic flowing over them both.At first, Toadling could not quite understand what was happening, and then she began to feel the magic, like water building up behind an earthen dam. It was a trickle, not a torrent, but it grew and grew, and one day, without even realizing how it happened, the magic split into two streams, the dam broke, and Toadling dropped down into another shape entirely.Duckwight clapped her webbed hands together and squalled with delight. The other greenteeth swarmed around them, patting Toadling and praising her. She did the trick for them again and again, and the greenteeth slapped their bony hands together and called her by the name that she would bear for the rest of her life.Surrounded by child-eating swamp spirits, Toadling felt intensely loved</td>

I had written most of it, had it lying around in my mental trunk, and wasn’t sure what to do with it. Novellas were hard to place at the time. There was one magazine that told me flat out that they couldn’t afford to pay me anything like what it was worth, which I respected, but which left me with this weird wrong-length … thingy.And then I saw that Tor had an open submission period for novellas coming up.Huh, I thought. I should send this in. When is that, again?Then, a few minutes later: Waaaaait a minute—I have an agent! Agents don’t have to wait for that! They can just send in books!(I have written more than forty books now, and I am still sometimes not entirely clear on this whole “being a professional writer” gig.)So my agent sent in Thornhedge, and Tor very kindly came back and said, “Yes, we will take this, and also, what else you got?” which is why Nettle &amp; Bone and What Moves the Dead have also come out by the time you’re reading this. So I am very grateful to them for taking the chance, and also to Toadling, weird as it is to be grateful to a figment of your imagination, for paving the way.</td>

The swim bladder of fish helps them control their buoyancy, similar to the ballast tanks of submarines. Even the agricultural revolution wasn’t that, well, revolutionary. Several ant species have long known how to cultivate fungus gardens and herd aphids for their “milk,” gently stroking them with their antennas to release droplets of honeydew, a sweet fluid they excrete after feasting on sap or leaves. A humpback’s throat is, in essence, large-scale origami, but with folds of skin rather than factory-made paper, expanding thanks to as many as thirty-six grooves that stretch to capture prey and collapse into a compact form when done.<br/> This book is an in-between art: part discovery, part</td>

Using his talent for making lenses, he heated thin filaments of glass into small spheres to construct a microscope. Out of curiosity, van Leeuwenhoek aimed his microscope at the scummy water he scooped out of a pond and the white stuff (“as thick as wetted flower”) scraped off his own teeth.6 What he witnessed was a sheer thrill. Who truly gets to say they have discovered a new world, like the hero in some childhood fantasy? Van Leeuwenhoek saw “small living animals, which moved themselves very extravagantly.” He was also the first to see red blood cells, sperm (taken from his own marital bed), and the vast unseen life of Earth’s littlest residents, which he called “animalcules.” And yet, because he refused to share his lens-making methods, no one but van Leeuwenhoek could see this microcosmos he kept jabbering about.

<td>IN 1874, INVENTOR Alexander Graham Bell was a twenty-seven-year-old with a dark, bushy beard working on a world-changing invention, and he was doing so by peering at the swirls of a cadaver’s ear, an exquisite fleshy instrument that has taken millions of years to develop. Bell was astonished by how the ear’s thin membrane could move the weight of the middle ear bones: “It occurred to me that if a membrane as thin as tissue paper could control the vibration of bones that were, compared to it, of immense size and weight, why should not a larger and thicker membrane be able to vibrate a piece of iron in front of an electromagnet?”1 Beside a sketch in his notebook, he scribbled down, “Make transmitting instrument after the model of the human ear. Make armature the shape of the ossicles [small bones in the human ear]. Follow out the analogy of nature.”2<br/> Bell had good reason to explore this line of inquiry: both his mother and his wife were deaf, and he taught students with hearing impediments. When he built his ear phon-autograph, he used the actual bones of a human ear mounted on a wood frame. Voices caused the bones to vibrate and visually represent the sound waves as etchings on a smoked-glass plate. The invention was meant to be a tool for his deaf students, but it leapfrogged his imagination to insight that eventually led to his telephone patent in 1876. Sitting in his laboratory, he famously spoke to his assistant on the phone in another room and said, “Mr. Watson, come here. I want to see you.”3</td>

She crawled on her stomach toward a less-damaged area, kicking Kumar to get him to follow.<br/>			At the one-minute mark, the arena lights dimmed, causing a momentary pause in the assault. A green warning light flashed. Mops risked another peek to see whether it would be enough to scare them off, but the Krakau kept closing in.<br/>			Forty seconds. Mops grabbed Kumar’s collar and pressed him to the ground. Doc continued to ping her with suit puncture alerts from stone fragments.<br/>			“Where the hell is station security?” Mops muttered. “Rubin can’t have been the only guard down here.” The Krakau must have found a way to disable or distract the others.<br/>			At fifteen seconds, a series of tarnished metal nozzles poked out of the ceiling like animals leaving their burrows. None of the Krakau appeared to notice. Nor were they likely to hear the pumps starting up.<br/>			She silently counted down the final seconds. “Keep your head down and shield your eyes.”<br/>			The countdown flashed zero.<br/>			Nothing happened.<br/>			“He said three minutes, right? That was exactly three—”<br/>			“Kumar! Why isn’t it working?”<br/>			“It’s old tech,” Kumar protested. “The timing mechanism probably needs to be recalibrated or replaced. Do you want me to add it to the maintenance log?”<br/>			Before Mops could answer, jets of heated cleaning fluid—a mix of water, alcohol, and lots of detergent—shot down with enough force to knock one of the guns from her hand. She retrieved it and holstered both of her weapons, counted five seconds, and climbed to her feet.<br/>			Krakau were sensitive to temperature extremes, and these jets were easily powerful enough to cause bruising. Neither of those things would stop a determined Krakau with a gun.<br/>			The detergent was another matter.</td>

She lunged to retrieve it, missed, and kept on sliding down the aisle . . . directly into Mops’ path. Mops gripped the closest seat for balance and met the Krakau with a swift kick, launching her three rows up like an Earth football.<br/>			“You’ll appreciate this story, Kumar.” She limped toward the next Krakau. “Eight years ago, we had a malfunction in the bridge lift autocleaner. Commander Danube was completely doused. She spent the next two days slipping and falling like her limbs had turned to greased ice.”<br/>			The second Krakau fumbled with her weapon, trying to bring it to bear on Mops. Mops reached down to dig her fingers into one of the Krakau’s primary tentacles. Using the tentacle as a handle, she spun the Krakau through the air, then slammed her to the ground. The unconscious Krakau slid away like a Glacidae ice puck.<br/>			“Krakau secrete several different chemicals from their skins,” Mops continued. “One makes them slick and harder for predators to hold. Another forms a thin layer of biological gel on their limbs, which allows them to grip almost any surface. Industrial detergent dissolves one of these two chemicals. Guess which one?</td>

If he was working for Heart of Glass, assigned to follow or spy on them, he wouldn’t be trying to pick a fight. “Look, son. We’re in a hurry, so I’m going to jump to the end of this conversation.

That’s right, I see the scabs where you’ve cut yourself.”<br/>			The Prodryan started to protest, but Mops moved closer and kept talking. “I know what it’s like to want to prove yourself. You figure you’ll push around a couple of humans and act like a real warrior in front of your friend there.”<br/>			She unsealed and removed her left glove, letting it dangle from her cuff. Her right hand shot out to seize the Prodryan’s wrist.

Soon after she returned to both marriage and music, she was diagnosed with MS.<br/>			Jacqueline du Pré’s cello voice remained her only voice. Hilary called it her sister’s salvation. It was not. It worked for audiences, but it did not work for her. People loved her impassioned music making, but no one who mattered ever truly listened. Audiences wept and critics sang her praises, but no one heard her. Tragically, she, too, was deaf to her true self. Artistic expression by itself is only a form of acting out emotions, not a way of working them through.<br/>			After her sister’s death, Hilary listened to a 1973 BBC tape of the Elgar concerto, with Zubin Mehta conducting. It had been Jackie’s final public performance in Britain. “A few moments of tuning, a short pause, and she began. I suddenly jumped. She was slowing the tempo down. A few more bars and it became vividly clear. I knew exactly what was happening. Jackie, as always, was speaking through her cello. I could hear what she was saying. . . . I could almost see tears on her face. She was saying goodbye to herself, playing her own requiem.”</td>

Indeed, stress can be produced under deep anaesthesia in patients who are unconscious, and even in cell cultures grown outside the body.”3 Similarly, stress effects can be highly active in persons who are fully awake, but who are in the grip of unconscious emotions or cut off from their body responses. The physiology of stress may be triggered without observable effects on behaviour and without subjective awareness, as has been shown in animal experiments and in human studies.</td>

<td>searching for a word to capture the meaning of the physical changes he observed in his experiments, Selye “stumbled upon the term stress, which had long been used in common English, and particularly in engineering, to denote the effects of a force acting against a resistance.” He gives the example of changes induced in a stretched rubber band or in a steel spring under pressure. These changes may be noted with the naked eye or may be evident only on microscopic examination.<br/>			Selye’s analogies illustrate an important point: excessive stress occurs when the demands made on an organism exceed that organism’s reasonable capacities to fulfill them. The rubber band snaps, the spring becomes deformed. The stress response can be set off by physical damage, either by infection or injury. It can also be triggered by emotional trauma or just by the threat of such trauma, even if purely imaginary. Physiological stress responses can be evoked when the threat is outside conscious awareness or even when the individual may believe himself to be stressed in a “good” way.</td>

The executive whose financial security is assured when he is terminated may still experience severe stress if his self-esteem and sense of purpose were completely bound up with his position in the company, compared with a colleague who finds greater value in family, social interests or spiritual pursuits. The loss of employment will be perceived as a major threat by the one, while the other may see it as an opportunity. There is no uniform and universal relationship between a stressor and the stress response. Each stress event is singular and is experienced in the present, but it also has its resonance from the past.

The brain needs to focus on the threat, forgetting about hunger or sexual drive. Stored energy supplies need to be mobilized, in the form of sugar molecules. The immune cells must be activated. Adrenaline, cortisol and the other stress substances fulfill those tasks.<br/>			All these functions must be kept within safe limits: too much sugar in the blood will cause coma; an overactive immune system will soon produce chemicals that are toxic.

What has happened is that we have lost touch with the gut feelings designed to be our warning system. The body mounts a stress response, but the mind is unaware of the threat. We keep ourselves in physiologically stressful situations, with only a dim awareness of distress or no awareness at all. As Selye pointed out, the salient stressors in the lives of most human beings today—at least in the industrialized world—are emotional. Just like laboratory animals unable to escape, people find themselves trapped in lifestyles and emotional patterns inimical to their health. The higher the level of economic development, it seems, the more anaesthetized we have become to our emotional realities.

<td>Hawking had always possessed tremendous cognitive and mathematical capacities and confidence, but he never seemed to feel comfortable in his body. “He was eccentric and awkward, skinny and puny,” write Michael White and John Gribbin in Stephen Hawking, A Life in Science. “His school uniform always looked a mess and, according to his friends, he jabbered rather than talked clearly. . . . He was just that sort of kid—a figure of classroom fun, teased and occasionally bullied, secretly respected by some and avoided by most.” He did not look to fulfill the expectations those who had glimpsed his true abilities held for him. The young Stephen, it appears, was the chosen bearer of the frustrated ambitions of his father who was evidently determined that his son would succeed at educational and social goals he, the father, had never quite attained. One goal was to have Stephen attend one of England’s most prestigious private schools. The ten-year-old-boy was entered for the Westminster School scholarship examination: “The day of the examination arrived, and Stephen fell ill. He never sat the entrance paper and consequently never obtained a place at one of England’s best schools.”<br/>			One may assume, of course, that this untimely illness was purely coincidental. We may also see it as the child’s only way of saying no to parental pressure. Given the Hawking family’s penchant for privacy, the facts would be difficult to discern. What we do know is that later on, with the young Hawking no longer living at home and at liberty to follow his preferences, these appeared to be more of a social than academic nature.

For Stephen the source of this nurturing was his wife, now his former wife, Jane Hawking. In essence, she decided to devote her life to him—at great personal cost to herself, as she would come to learn. The two met just before Stephen’s diagnosis with ALS and were married shortly afterwards. Due to her own history, Jane was primed to accept the role of devoted and selfless caregiver. I write selfless here advisedly: there was lacking in her a developed, autonomous sense of self, and thus she completely identified with her role as Stephen’s nurse, mother and guardian angel. “I wanted to find some purpose to my existence,” she recalls in her 1993 memoir, Music to Move the Stars, “and I supposed I found it in the idea of looking after him.” When she doubted her ability to fulfill that daunting task, friends told her, “If he needs you, you must do it.” She took it on.</td>

Without the subordination of Jane’s life and independent strivings to his, Stephen likely would not have survived, let alone succeeded to such a spectacular degree. His biographers assert that “without the help that Jane gave him, he almost certainly would not have been able to carry on, or had the will to do so.”10<br/>			The relationship worked as long as Jane accepted her self-abnegating position and the one-way flow of psychic energy between them, from wife to husband. The couple loved each other, but she would come to feel used. She recounts a strange incident when, in 1965, she arrived at her fiancé’s apartment with a broken arm in a cast: “He was actually expecting that I would put my secretarial skills to good use by typing out a job application for him. The look of horrified dismay that spread across his face as I walked into his room with my left arm bulging beneath my coat in a white plaster cast dashed all my hopes of even the merest display of sympathy.”<br/>			The episode encapsulated the nature of their relationship: she was the ever-available, unspeaking and compliant mother/nanny figure whose services are expected, taken for granted and noticed only in their absence. She travelled the world with her husband, daily confronting and overcoming myriad difficulties that were only much later—and even then only partially—eased once he became an internationally famous and high-earning author. She felt herself gradually disappear as an individual. She was sucked dry, sensing herself becoming a “brittle, empty shell, alone and vulnerable,” and nearly suicidal. Hawking, for his part, reacted to her strivings for independence with disdain and finally with the rage of a child deserted by his mother. The wife was eventually supplanted by a nurse who left her own husband to marry the scientist. Jane, too, had found another love. It was only this outside relationship that, in the final years of the marriage, allowed her to continue to serve Stephen as long as she did.<br/>			Hawking’s</td>

Hawking’s intellectual self-assuredness became the ground for that aggression to manifest itself, particularly after the onset of his physical decline. Jane Hawking notes in her memoir that “curiously, as his gait became more unsteady so his opinions became more forceful and defiant.”<br/>			Like that of all the ALS sufferers we have met, Hawking’s personality has been characterized by intense psychological repression. In his family of origin, healthy vulnerability and emotional interaction appear to have been perceived as foreign. At</td>

<td>After she had had the disease for some years, she began to lose control over her breathing muscles as well as the rest of her body. Her breathing difficulties made her think she was going to die. But she decided at that point that she wanted to experience unconditional love for herself at least once before dying. Describing herself as a “bowl of Jell-O in a wheelchair,” she sat every day for fifteen minutes in front of a mirror and chose different parts of herself to love. She started with her hands, because at that time they were the only parts of herself that she could appreciate unconditionally. Each day she went on to other body parts. . . . <br/>			She also wrote in a journal about insights she had during this process, and she came to see that since childhood she had believed that in order to be of service, acceptable to others, and worthy of herself, she had to sacrifice her own needs. It took a life-threatening disease for her to learn that service through self-sacrifice is a dead end.11<br/>			According to Dr. Northrup, her friend healed through the conscious daily practice of emotional self-inventory and of self-love that, little by little, “unfroze” each part of her body. Had I read such a story when I graduated from medical school, I would have dismissed it out of hand. Even now, the scientifically trained physician in me would like to see direct proof that ALS was legitimately diagnosed in this case. In palliative work I once saw a person admitted for “respite care” who had convinced herself and her circle of friends that she suffered from ALS, despite the electrodiagnostic testing and neurological findings having all been, repeatedly, perfectly normal. The friends scarcely believed me when I informed them that the invalid they had been assiduously caring for was, from the narrow physical point of view, as healthy as they were.<br/>			Today I do not find Dr. Northrup’s report impossible to credit. It accords with my understanding of this disease. There was an intriguing incident in the story of Alexa, the teacher whose husband, Peter, could not accept the diagnosis of ALS. It revealed the potential of something that, perhaps, may have been. The psychologist Gordon Neufeld managed on only one occasion to see her alone, without her spouse. “It was</td>

But I could never meet with her alone again, and I could never get her to that place again. The window just shut.”</td>

<td>THE LARGE MAJORITY OF LUNG cancers are caused by carcinogens and tumour promoters ingested via cigarette smoking,” says the twelfth edition of Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine.

<td>Kissen’s insights were confirmed in spectacular fashion by a prospective study German, Dutch and Serbian researchers conducted over a ten-year period in Cvrenka, in the former Yugoslavia. The purpose of the study was to investigate the relationship of psychosocial risk factors to mortality. Cvrenka, an industrial town of about fourteen thousand inhabitants, was chosen partly because it was known to have a high mortality rate and partly because its stable population base permitted easier follow-up.<br/>			Nearly 10 per cent of the town’s inhabitants were selected, about one thousand men and four hundred women. Each was interviewed in 1965–66, with a 109-item questionnaire that delineated such risk factors as adverse life events, a sense of long-lasting hopelessness and a hyper-rational, non-emotional coping style. Physical parameters like cholesterol levels, weight, blood pressure and smoking history were also recorded. People with already diagnosed disease were excluded from the research project.<br/>			By 1976, ten years later, over six hundred of the study participants had died of cancer, heart disease, stroke or other causes. The single greatest risk factor for death—and especially for cancer death—was what the researchers called rationality and anti-emotionality, or R/A. The eleven questions identifying R/A measured a single trait: the repression of anger. “Indeed cancer incidence was some 40 times higher in those who answered positively to 10 or 11 of the questions for R/A than in the remaining subjects, who answered positively to about 3 questions on average. . . .We found that smokers had no incidence of lung cancer unless they also had R/A scores of 10 or 11, suggesting that any effect of smoking on the lung is essentially limited to a ‘susceptible minority</td>

<td>Doubling time—the amount of time needed for a tumour mass to double in size—varies from one cancer type to another, and there are great variations within individual cancer types. For a tumour to become clinically noticeable, even on an easily accessible body tissue like the skin or the breast, it has to become about half a gram in size, comprising about five hundred million cells. A single cell with a malignant mutation would have to double about thirty times to reach such dimensions.18 In breast cancer, doubling time has been calculated to range from a few days to one and one-half years, with an average of about four months. “If a tumour cell were to grow constantly at the last rate, it would take about eight years to become clinically evident, and some sources suggest an even longer doubling time with a time span of about 15–20 years to become clinically evident.”</td>

Not one of the many adults interviewed for this book could answer in the affirmative when asked the following: When, as a child, you felt sad, upset or angry, was there anyone you could talk to—even when he or she was the one who had triggered your negative emotions? In a quarter century of clinical practice, including a decade of palliative work, I have never heard anyone with cancer or with any chronic illness or condition say yes to that question. Many children are conditioned in this manner not because of any intended harm or abuse, but because the parents themselves are too threatened by the anxiety, anger or sadness they sense in their child—or are simply too busy or too harassed themselves to pay attention. “My mother or father needed me to be happy” is the simple formula that trained many a child—later a stressed and depressed or physically ill adult—into lifelong patterns of repression</td>

<td>Pain from distension of the colon or other parts of the intestine can also be studied by inserting an endoscope into the bowel and then inflating a balloon attached to the scope. In such studies, the functional patient groups repeatedly exhibit a hypersensitivity to distension. They report that the pain from this procedure is similar to the pain they usually experience. One study compared the effects of balloon inflation in IBS sufferers and controls. “Balloon inflation to 60 ml caused pain in 6 per cent of control subjects and 55 per cent of IBS patients. . . . Estimated gut wall tension at different volumes was similar in the two groups. However, the incidence of pain in relation to wall tension was increased by nearly ten-fold in the IBS group.”4<br/>			Parallel observations have been made elsewhere in the digestive tract, from the esophagus to the small intestine.

There is a high incidence of abuse in the histories of patients with intestinal diseases and especially in those patients with IBS and other functional disorders.<br/>			In a 1990 study of women patients conducted at the gastroenterology clinic of the North Carolina School of Medicine, 44 per cent of the women reported some type of sexual and/or physical abuse. “Those with abuse history had a four-fold greater risk of pelvic pain, two to three times more non-abdominal symptoms (e.g., headaches, backaches, fatigue), as well as more lifetime surgeries.”7 In a more recent investigation at the same centre, fully two-thirds of the women interviewed had experienced abuse of a physical or sexual nature, or both.

<td>The gut responds to emotional stimuli by muscle contractions, blood flow changes and the secretion of a multitude of biologically active substances. Such brain-gut integration is essential for survival. Large volumes of blood, for example, may need to be diverted from the intestines to the heart and to the muscles of the limbs at a moment’s notice.<br/>			In turn, the gut is abundantly supplied with sensory nerves that carry information to the brain. Quite to the contrary of what was believed until recently, nerve fibres ascending from the intestines to the brain greatly outnumber ones descending from brain to gut.10<br/>			The brain relays to the gut data from sensory organs such as the eyes, the skin or the ears—or more correctly, relayed to the gut is the interpretation of such data by the brain’s emotional centres. The resulting physiological events in the gut then reinforce that emotional interpretation. The signals sent back to the brain give rise to gut feelings that we can apprehend consciously. If we lose touch with gut feelings, the world becomes less safe.<br/>			Obviously, life would not be livable if we felt every micro-event in our bodies. Digestion, breathing, blood flow to organs or limbs and myriad other functions must take place without intruding on consciousness. There has to be a threshold below which the brain does not register sensation, below which stimuli are accepted as unremarkable but above which the brain will be alerted to potential danger from within or without. There needs to be, in other words, a well-calibrated thermostat for pain and other sensations.<br/>			When there are too many “gut-wrenching” experiences, the neurological apparatus can become oversensitized. Thus, in the spinal cord the conduction of pain from gut to brain is adjusted as a result of psychological trauma. The nerves involved are set off by weaker stimuli. The greater the trauma, the lower becomes the sensory threshold. A normal amount of gas in the intestinal lumen and a normal level of tension in the intestinal wall will trigger pain in the sensitized person.<br/>			</td>

<td>The medical name for the distressing chronic experience of stomach acid flowing upward into the esophagus is gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Researchers in 1992 studied the relationship of reflux symptoms to stress in subjects diagnosed with GERD. While the perception of reflux-associated heartburn by these patients was markedly increased during the stressful stimuli, the objective measures of acid levels were unchanged from one stimulus to another. Stress, in other words, lowered the pain threshold.13<br/>			An intestinal specialist unfamiliar with the neurophysiology or psychology of pain who looked at Patricia’s lower esophagus through an endoscope could, in good conscience, tell her that the acid reflux he observed was inadequate to explain the degree of her pain. And Patricia, in equally good conscience, would be incensed by what she perceived as the callous dismissal of a symptom that is a source of intense daily discomfort in her life.<br/>			This is not to say that people with GERD do not experience more frequent reflux than other people. They probably do, and, once more, it is a brain-gut problem. Investigators comparing healthy controls with reflux patients found that the resting pressure of the esophageal sphincter was more frequently low in the GERD subjects. The decreased efficiency of the sphincter muscles permitted more episodes of reflux.14<br/>			How can the mind and the brain contribute to reflux? It happens by means of the vagus nerve, which is responsible for the tone of the muscles of the lower esophageal sphincter. In turn, the activity of the vagus is influenced by the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus, as we have seen, receives input from the emotional centres in the cortex that are susceptible to stress. Thus, in GERD, a lower pain threshold is combined with excessive relaxation of the sphincter—both phenomena that can be related to stress.<br/>			The three women interviewed for this chapter described similar</td>

<td>Could early life experience, emotional repression and lifelong stress predispose to Alzheimer’s? Scientific research indicates so, as does a close look at the lives of people with Alzheimer’s—whether common folk or the famous, like Swift or the former U.S. president Ronald Reagan. An interesting clue that early relationships may be crucial in the later development of dementia comes from animal experimentation. Rats who receive gentle handling in infancy suffer virtually no loss of hippocampal cells in advanced age.1 Their capacity to remember remains intact. By comparison, non-handled rats are more likely to suffer shrinkage of the hippocampus and also exhibit greater memory impairment in old age.<br/>			In humans, the widely reported Nun Study found that low linguistic ability in early life had a strong association with dementia and premature death in late life. The retrospective research examined the handwritten autobiographies of a group of young postulants (candidate nuns), completed during their first year in the convent. Their mean age at the time of writing was twenty-three. More than six decades later, researchers asked to see the autobiographical statements each had made, and in addition, these now aged nuns were examined for mental health and acuity. As part of the study, each nun was asked and gave permission for an autopsy to be performed after her death. It turned out that those who had expressed a paucity of ideas and had used less vivid language in their youthful memoirs were proportionately more likely to have developed clinical Alzheimer’s as they grew older, along with the characteristic pathological findings in the brain.2</td>

There had been the anecdote he had told Medal of Honor winners about the Eighth Air Force bomber pilot who, when his B-17 was mortally hit by flak, ordered the crew to parachute out. Just as the pilot was about to jump from the flaming aircraft himself, he discovered that the ball gunner was trapped in his turret, wounded and unable to get out of the hatch above him, terrified of dying alone. The pilot took off his parachute. . . . and lay down on the floor so that he could put his arm into the turret and hold the dying boy’s hand. “Don’t sweat it, son,” he told the gunner, “we’ll go down together,” as the plane plunged to the ground.<br/>			This brought tears to Reagan’s eyes and to the eyes of the Medal of Honor winners.

Your son. Mike,” his first-born child once pleaded with him as Reagan blinked at him uncomprehendingly among a group of fellow students.<br/>			The then-future president once described himself as “the calm vacant center of the hurricane.” Morris writes that there was always about Ronald Reagan’s personality an “immense insularity . . . , the child was already sheathed in a strange calm . . .

With a modified ADH4, alcohol can be consumed safely and used by our bodies as a source of energy.

In the eavesdropping scenario, there is nothing that we might recognize as deliberate behavior on the part of the sender. As Kiers explained, “If a tree gets attacked by an insect then of course it’s going to scream in its language: It will produce some sort of chemical to get ready for the attack.” These chemicals could easily spill over from one plant into another through the network. Nothing is actively sent. The receiver plant just happens to notice. Johnson uses the same analogy. If we hear someone screaming, it doesn’t mean they are screaming in order to warn us of something. Sure, a scream may cause us to change our behavior, but it doesn’t imply any intention on the part of the screamer. “You’re just eavesdropping on their response to a particular situation.”<br/>			<br/>			 It may seem like splitting hairs, but a lot turns on which way we read the interaction. Either way, a stimulus moves from one plant to another and allows the receiver to prepare itself for attack. However, if plants do send a message, we would think of it as a signal. If their neighbors are eavesdropping, we would think of it as a cue. How best to interpret the behavior of shared mycorrhizal networks is a sensitive subject. Some researchers are concerned about how wood wide webs are commonly portrayed. “Just because we found that plants can respond to a neighbor,” Johnson told me, “doesn’t mean that there is some altruistic network in operation.” The idea that plants are talking to each other and warning each other of imminent attack is an anthropomorphic delusion. “It’s very attractive to think that way,” he admitted, but it’s ultimately “a load of nonsense.”<br/></td>

Adamatzky estimates that a network of honey fungus stretching over fifteen hectares would have nearly a trillion such processing units.<br/>			 For Adamatzky, the point of fungal computers is not to replace silicon chips. Fungal reactions are too slow for that. Rather, he thinks humans could use mycelium growing in an ecosystem as a “large-scale environmental sensor.” Fungal networks, he reasons, are monitoring a large number of data streams as part of their everyday existence. If we could plug into mycelial networks and interpret the signals they use to process information, we could learn more about what was happening in an ecosystem. Fungi could report changes in soil quality, water purity, pollution, or any other features of the environment that they are sensitive to.<br/>			 We’re some way off. Computing with living network-based organisms is in its infancy and many questions remain unanswered. Olsson and Adamatzky have shown that mycelium can be electrically sensitive, but they haven’t shown that electrical impulses can link a stimulus to a response. It is as if you had stuck a pin in your toe, detected the nerve impulse that traveled through your body, but hadn’t been able to measure your reaction to the pain.<br/>			<br/>			 This is a challenge for the future. In the twenty-three years between Olsson’s study on mycelium and Adamatzky’s study on oyster mushrooms, no further research was conducted on electrical signaling in fungi. If he had the resources to pursue this line of inquiry, Olsson told me that he would try to demonstrate a clear physiological response to changes in electrical activity and decode the patterns of electrical impulses. His dream is to “hook up a fungus with a computer and communicate with it,” to use electrical signals to get the fungus to change its behavior. “All sorts of weird and wonderful experiments could be done if this turns out to be right.”</td>

Up to this point, scientists lacked the tools to analyze the structure and properties of complex networks, despite their prevalence in human life. The branch of mathematics that models networks—graph theory—was unable to describe the behavior of most networks in the real world, and many questions remained unanswered. How could epidemics and computer viruses spread so quickly? Why could some networks continue to function despite massive disruption? Out of Barabási’s study of the World Wide Web emerged new mathematical tools. A few key principles appeared to govern the behavior of a wide range of networks, from human sexual relationships to biochemical interactions within organisms.

Pick any field of study—from neuroscience, to biochemistry, to economic systems, disease epidemics, web search engines, machine learning algorithms that underpin much of AI, to astronomy and the very structure of the universe itself, a cosmic web crisscrossed with filaments of gas and clusters of galaxies—and chances are that it makes sense of the phenomenon using a network model.<br/></td>

It’s a question that has been pored over for decades by mycologists and magic-mushroom enthusiasts alike.<br/>			<br/>			 It’s possible that psilocybin didn’t do much at all for the fungi that made it until humans came along. There are lots of compounds in fungi and plants that accumulate in biochemical backwaters playing Z-list roles as incidental metabolic by-products. Sometimes these “secondary compounds” encounter an animal that they attract, confound, or kill, at which point they might start to benefit the fungus and become an evolutionary adaptation. However, sometimes they don’t do much more than provide variations on a biochemical theme that might one day prove useful, or not.<br/>			 Two studies published in 2018 suggest that psilocybin did provide a benefit to the fungi that could make it. Analysis of the DNA of psilocybin-producing fungal species reveals that the ability to make psilocybin evolved more than once. More surprising was the finding that the cluster of genes needed to make psilocybin has jumped between fungal lineages by horizontal gene transfer several times over the course of its history.</td>

Equipped with this “grammar of animacy,” it is possible to talk about the life of other organisms without either reducing them to an “it” or borrowing concepts traditionally reserved for humans. By contrast, in English, writes Kimmerer, there is no way to recognize the “simple existence of another living being.” If you’re not a human subject, by default you’re an inanimate object: an “it,” a “mere thing.” If you repurpose a human concept to help make sense of the life of a nonhuman organism, you’ve tumbled into the trap of anthropomorphism.

<td>In 1967, the visionary American biologist Lynn Margulis became a vocal proponent of a controversial theory that gave symbiosis a central role in the evolution of early life. Margulis argued that some of the most significant moments in evolution had resulted from the coming together—and staying together—of different organisms. Eukaryotes arose when a single-celled organism engulfed a bacterium, which continued to live symbiotically inside it. Mitochondria were the descendants of these bacteria. Chloroplasts were the descendants of photosynthetic bacteria that had been engulfed by an early eukaryotic cell. All complex life that followed, human life included, was a story of the long-lasting “intimacy of strangers.”<br/>			<br/>			 The idea that eukaryotes had arisen “by fusion and merger” had drifted in and out of biological thought since the start of the twentieth century, but it had remained at the margins of “polite biological society.” By 1967, little had changed, and Margulis’s manuscript was rejected fifteen times before it was finally accepted. After publication, her ideas were vigorously opposed, as similar suggestions had been before. (In 1970, the microbiologist Roger Stanier waspishly remarked that Margulis’s “evolutionary speculation…can be considered a relatively harmless habit, like eating peanuts, unless it assumes the form of an obsession; then it becomes a vice.”) However, in the 1970s Margulis was proved correct. New genetic tools revealed that mitochondria and chloroplasts had indeed started off as free-living bacteria. Since then, other examples of endosymbiosis have been found.

<td>Howard’s tone is dramatic, but eighty years on his questions cut deep. By some measures, modern industrial agriculture has been effective: Crop production doubled over the second half of the twentieth century. But a single-minded focus on yield has incurred steep costs. Agriculture causes widespread environmental destruction and is responsible for a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. Between twenty and forty percent of crops are lost each year to pests and diseases, despite colossal applications of pesticides. Global agricultural yields have plateaued, despite a seven-hundred-fold increase in fertilizer use over the second half of the twentieth century. Worldwide, thirty football fields’ worth of topsoil are lost to erosion every minute. Yet a third of food is wasted, and demand for crops will double by 2050. It is difficult to overstate the urgency of the crisis.<br/>			<br/>			 Could mycorrhizal fungi form part of the solution? Perhaps it’s a silly question. Mycorrhizal relationships are as old as plants and have been shaping Earth’s future for hundreds of millions of years. They have forever featured in our efforts to feed ourselves, whether we’ve thought about them or not. For millennia in many parts of the world, traditional agricultural practices have attended to the health of the soil, and thus supported plants’ fungal relationships implicitly. But over the course of the twentieth century, our neglect has led us into trouble. In 1940, Howard’s greatest worry was that industrial agricultural techniques would develop without taking account of the “life of the soil.” His concern was justified. In viewing soils as more or less lifeless places, agricultural practices have ravaged the underground communities that sustain the life we eat. There are parallels with much of twentieth-century medical science, which considered “germ” and “microbe” to mean the same thing. Of course some soil organisms, like some microbes that live on your body, can cause disease. Most do quite the opposite. Disrupt the ecology of microbes that live in your gut, and your health will suffer—a growing number of human diseases are known to arise because of efforts to rid ourselves of “germs.” Disrupt the rich ecology of microbes that live in the soil—the guts of the planet—and the health of plants, too, will suffer.<br/></td>

Some—including the commonly cultivated oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus)—produce hyphal stalks capped with a single toxic droplet that paralyzes nematodes, giving the hypha enough time to grow through their mouth and digest the worm from the inside.

Schwendener proposed that the lichen fungus (known today as the “mycobiont”) offered physical protection and acquired nutrients for itself and for the algal cells.

To attract an animal the aroma has to be curious, and delicious—yes. But most of all it has to be penetrating and strong. It doesn’t really matter whether their spores are scattered by a wild boar or a flying squirrel, so why be picky? Most hungry animals will chase a delicious smell. Moreover, a truffle doesn’t change its aroma in response to your immediate attentions. It can excite, but it isn’t excitable. Its signal billows out loud and clear, and once begun, it is always on. A ripe truffle broadcasts an unambiguous summons in chemical lingua franca, a pop scent with mass appeal that could cause Daniele, Paride, two dogs, a mouse, and me to converge at a single point under a bramble bush on a muddy bank in Italy.<br/>			 Truffles—like many other highly prized fungal fruiting bodies—are their parent fungus’s least sophisticated channels of communication. Much of fungal life, including the growth of mycelium, depends on subtler forms of allure. There are two key moves by which fungal hyphae become a mycelial network. First, they branch. Second, they fuse. (The process by which hyphae merge with each other is known as “anastomosis,” which in Greek means “to provide with a mouth.”) If hyphae couldn’t branch, one hypha could never become many. If hyphae couldn’t fuse with one another, they would not be able to grow into complex networks. However, before they fuse, hyphae must find other hyphae, which they do by attracting one another, a phenomenon known as “homing.” Fusion between hyphae is the linking stitch that makes mycelium mycelium, the most basic networking act. In this sense, the mycelium of any fungus arises from its ability to attract itself to itself.<br/></td>

Within minutes his mycological patter picks up speed, and he leaps between bulletins almost faster than he can talk, a ceaseless torrent of fungal enthusiasm. In his world, fungal solutions run amok. Give him an insoluble problem and he’ll toss you a new way it can be decomposed, poisoned, or healed by a fungus. Much of the time, he wears a hat made from amadou—a feltlike material produced from the fruiting body of the tinder fungus, or Fomes fomentarius, another white rot fungus. It carries fitting associations. Amadou has been used by humans as a firestarter for thousands of years—it was carried by the Iceman, the five-thousand-year-old corpse preserved in glacial ice. As a tool of —thermal—combustion, it is one of the most ancient examples of human radical mycology currently known.<br/>			 Not long before I arrived, Stamets had been contacted by the creative team behind the TV series Star Trek: Discovery, who wanted to know more about his work. He had agreed to brief them on the ways that fungi could be used to save worlds. Sure enough, Star Trek: Discovery, which premiered the next year, was laced with mycological themes. A new character was introduced, a brilliant astromycologist called Lieutenant Paul Stamets, who uses fungi to develop powerful technologies that can be deployed to save humanity in a fight against a series of terminal threats. The Star Trek team has taken plenty of license, though they hardly needed to. By tapping into intergalactic mycelial networks—“an infinite number of roads, leading everywhere”—(the fictional) Stamets and his team work out how to travel in the “mycelial plane” faster than the speed of light. Following his first mycelial immersion, Stamets comes to, dazed and transformed. “I’ve spent my whole life trying to grasp the essence of mycelium. And now I do. I saw the network.

<td> accepted the offer of a PhD to study mycorrhizal relationships in tropical forests in Panama. Soon afterward, I moved to a field station on an island run by the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. The island and surrounding peninsulas were part of a nature reserve entirely covered by forest, apart from a clearing for dormitories, a canteen, and lab buildings. There were greenhouses for growing plants, drying cupboards filled with bags of leaf litter, a room lined with microscopes, and a walk-in freezer packed with samples: bottles of tree sap, dead bats, tubes containing ticks pulled from the backs of spiny rats and boa constrictors. Posters on the notice board offered cash rewards to anyone who could source fresh ocelot droppings from the forest.<br/>			 The jungle bristled with life. There were sloths, pumas, snakes, crocodiles; there were basilisk lizards that could run across the surface of water without sinking. In just a few hectares there lived as many woody plant species as in the whole of Europe. The diversity of the forest was reflected in the rich variety of field biologists who came there to study it. Some climbed trees and observed ants. Some set out at dawn every day to follow the monkeys. Some tracked the lightning that struck trees during tropical storms. Some spent their days suspended from a crane measuring ozone concentrations in the forest canopy. Some warmed up the soil using electrical elements to see how bacteria might respond to global heating. Some studied the way beetles navigate using the stars. Bumblebees, orchids, butterflies—there seemed to be no aspect of life in the forest that someone wasn’t observing.<br/>			<br/>			 I was struck by the creativity and humor of this community of researchers. Lab biologists spend most of their time in charge of the pieces of life they study. Their own human lives are lived outside the flasks that contain their subject matter. Field biologists rarely have so much control. The world is the flask and they’re inside it. The balance of power is different. Storms wash away the flags that mark their experiments. Trees fall on their plots. Sloths die where they planned to measure the nutrients in the soil. Bullet ants sting them as they crash past. The forest and its inhabitants dispel any illusions that scientists are in charge. Humility quickly sets in.<br/></td>

<td>Noses are finely tuned instruments. Your olfactory sense can split complex mixtures into their constituent chemicals, just as a prism can split white light into its constituent colors. To do this, it must detect the precise arrangement of atoms within a molecule. Mustard smells mustardy because of bonds between nitrogen, carbon, and sulfur. Fish smells fishy because of bonds between nitrogen and hydrogen. Bonds between carbon and nitrogen smell metallic and oily.<br/>			 The ability to detect and respond to chemicals is a primordial sensory ability. Most organisms use their chemical senses to explore and make sense of their environment. Plants, fungi, and animals all use similar types of receptors to detect chemicals. When molecules bind to these receptors, they trigger a signaling cascade: One molecule triggers a cellular change, which triggers a bigger change, and so on. In this way, small causes can ripple into large effects: Human noses can detect some compounds at as low a concentration as thirty-four thousand molecules in one square centimeter, the equivalent of a single drop of water in twenty thousand Olympic swimming pools.<br/></td>

<td>Whether one calls slime molds, fungi, and plants “intelligent” depends on one’s point of view. Classical scientific definitions of intelligence use humans as a yardstick by which all other species are measured. According to these anthropocentric definitions, humans are always at the top of the intelligence rankings, followed by animals that look like us (chimpanzees, bonobos, etc.), followed again by other “higher” animals, and onward and downward in a league table—a great chain of intelligence drawn up by the ancient Greeks, which persists one way or another to this day. Because these organisms don’t look like us or outwardly behave like us—or have brains—they have traditionally been allocated a position somewhere at the bottom of the scale. Too often, they are thought of as the inert backdrop to animal life. Yet many are capable of sophisticated behaviors that prompt us to think in new ways about what it means for organisms to “solve problems,” “communicate,” “make decisions,” “learn,” and “remember.” As we do so, some of the vexed hierarchies that underpin modern thought start to soften. As they soften, our ruinous attitudes toward the more-than-human world may start to change.</td>

In some situations, lichens reproduce without breaking up their relationship—fragments of a lichen containing all the symbiotic partners can travel as one to a new location and grow into a new lichen. In other situations, lichen fungi produce spores that travel alone. Upon arrival in a new place, the fungus must meet a compatible photobiont and form their relationship afresh.<br/>			<br/>			 In joining forces, the fungal partners became part photobiont and the photobionts part fungus. Yet lichens resemble neither.

As Goward emphasizes, it is a point so simple that it is hard to grasp. “I often say that the only people who can’t see a lichen are lichenologists. It’s because they look at the parts, as scientists are trained to do. The trouble is that if you look at the parts of the lichen, you don’t see the lichen itself.”</td>

It is no less important for astrobiologists, including those on the BIOMEX team, many of whom wrestle with the question of “panspermia,” from the Greek pan meaning “all” and sperma meaning “seed.” Panspermia deals with the question of whether planets, too, are islands, and whether life can travel through space between celestial bodies. It is an idea that has circulated since antiquity, although it didn’t take on the form of a scientific hypothesis until the early twentieth century. Some advocates argue that life itself arrived from other planets. Some propose instead that life evolved on Earth and elsewhere, and periods of dramatic evolutionary novelty on Earth were triggered by the arrival of fragments of life from space. Others argue instead for a “soft-panspermia,” where life itself evolved on Earth but the chemical building blocks required for life arrived from space. There are many hypotheses as to how interplanetary transport might take place. Most are variations on a theme: Organisms get trapped within asteroids or other debris ejected from planets during collisions with meteorites, and hurtle through space before colliding with another planetary body on which they may or may not be able to make a life.</td>

Different varieties of apple have their own indigenous yeast cultures on their skins, each fermenting at its own pace, preferentially preserving and transforming different elements of the fruit’s flavor. Like all fermentations, it is a fine line. If rogue yeasts or bacteria become established, the juice goes rotten. A cider made with a single cultivated strain from a packet would be less likely to veer into a rot, but wouldn’t represent the apples’ own cultures of yeast.

<td>Brains are just one such network, one way of processing information. Even in animals, there is a lot that can take place without them. Researchers at Tufts University have illustrated this in striking experiments using flatworms. Flatworms are well-studied model organisms because of their ability to regenerate. If the head of a flatworm is cut off, it sprouts another head, brain and all. Flatworms can also be trained. The researchers wondered whether, if they trained a flatworm to remember features of its environment and then cut off its head, it would retain the memory when it has grown a new head and brain. Remarkably, the answer is yes. The flatworms’ memory appeared to reside in a part of their body outside the brain. These experiments suggest that even within the body of brain-dependent animals, the flexible networks that underpin complex behaviors need not be limited to a small region inside the head.

<td>Many types of organisms, then, have evolved flexible networks to help solve the problems that life presents. Mycelial organisms appear to be some of the first to do so. In 2017, researchers at the Swedish Royal Museum of Natural History published a report in which they describe fossilized mycelium preserved in the fractures of ancient lava flows. The fossils show branching filaments that “touch and entangle each other.” The “tangled network” they form, the dimensions of the hyphae, the dimensions of spore-like structures, and the pattern of its growth all closely resemble modern-day fungal mycelium. It is an extraordinary discovery because the fossils date from 2.4 billion years ago, more than a billion years before fungi were thought to have branched off the tree of life. There is no way to identify the organism with certainty, but whether or not it was a true fungus, it clearly had a mycelial habit. It is a finding that makes mycelium one of the earliest known gestures toward complex multicellular life, an original tangle, one of the first living networks. Remarkably unchanged, mycelium has persisted for more than half of the four billion years of life’s history, through countless cataclysms and catastrophic global transformations.</td>

Natural selection will favor truffle fungi that match the preferences of their finest spore dispersers. Truffles with better “chemistry” will attract animals more successfully than those with worse.

It was either for bread or for beer that humans started to give up their nomadic lifestyles and settle into sedentary societies (the beer-before-bread hypothesis has steadily gained traction among scholars since the 1980s). And whether in bread or in beer, yeasts were the primary beneficiaries of humans’ earliest agricultural efforts. In the preparation of either, humans feed yeast before they feed themselves.

As soon as one says it, people start thinking of brains like ours where we have language and process thoughts to make decisions.” His caution is well-placed. Brain is a trigger word, burdened with concepts that spend most of their time in the animal world. “When we say ‘brain,’ ” Olsson continued, “all associations are with animal brains.” Besides, as he pointed out, brains behave like brains because of the way they’re built. The architecture of animal brains is very different from that of fungal networks. In animal brains, neurons connect with other neurons at junctions called synapses. At synapses, signals can combine with other signals. Neurotransmitter molecules pass across synapses and allow different neurons to behave in different ways—some excite other neurons, some inhibit them. Mycelial networks don’t share any of these features.<br/>			<br/>			 But if fungi did use waves of electrical activity to transmit signals around a network, wouldn’t we think of mycelium as at least a brain-like phenomenon? In Olsson’s view, there could be other ways to regulate electrical impulses in mycelial networks to create “brain-like circuits, gates, and oscillators.” In some fungi, hyphae are divided into compartments by pores, which can be sensitively regulated. Opening or closing a pore changes the strength of the signal that passes from one compartment to another, whether chemical, pressure, or </td>

<td>Lichens mine minerals from rock in a twofold process known as “weathering.” First, they physically break up surfaces by the force of their growth. Second, they deploy an arsenal of powerful acids and mineral-binding compounds to dissolve and digest the rock. Lichens’ ability to weather makes them a geological force, yet they do more than dissolve the physical features of the world. When lichens die and decompose, they give rise to the first soils in new ecosystems. Lichens are how the inanimate mineral mass within rocks is able to cross over into the metabolic cycles of the living. A portion of the minerals in your body is likely to have passed through a lichen at some point. Whether on tombstones in a graveyard or encased within slabs of Antarctic granite, lichens are go-betweens that inhabit the boundary dividing life and nonlife. Looking out from the Caper at the rocky Canadian coastline, this becomes clear. Above the tideline, it is only after several meters of lichens and mosses that larger trees start to appear, rooted in crevices well beyond the water’s reach where young soils have been able to form.<br/></td>

They are coated with proteins that insulate them, which would allow waves of electrical activity to travel long distances without dissipating—animal nerve cells have an analogous insulating sheath. Moreover, the cells in a mycelium are continuous with one another, possibly allowing impulses initiated in one part of the network to reach another part without interruption.<br/>			 Olsson chose the species of fungus carefully. He surmised that if electrical communication systems did exist in fungi, it would be easier to detect in species with a greater need for communication over long distances. Just to be safe, he chose a honey fungus, or Armillaria—the species that forms the record-holding mycelial networks that stretch over kilometers and reach thousands of years in age.<br/>			 When Olsson inserted the microelectrodes into Armillaria’s hyphal strands, he detected regular action potential–like impulses, firing at a rate very close to that of animals’ sensory neurons—around four impulses per second, which traveled along hyphae at a speed of at least half a millimeter per second, some ten times faster than the fastest rate of fluid flow measured in a fungal hypha. This caught his attention, but in itself it didn’t suggest that the impulses formed the basis of a rapid signaling system. Electrical activity can only play a role in fungal communication if it is sensitive to stimulation. Olsson decided to measure the response of the fungus to blocks of wood, which is food for this species.<br/>			 Olsson set up the rig and placed a block of wood onto the mycelium several centimeters from the electrodes. What he found was extraordinary. When the wood came into contact with the mycelium, the firing rate of the impulses doubled. When he removed the block of wood, the firing rate returned to normal. To make sure that the fungi weren’t responding to the weight of the wooden block, he placed an inedible plastic block of the same size and weight onto the mycelium. The fungus didn’t respond.<br/>			<br/>			 Olsson went on to test a range of other species of fungus, including a mycorrhizal fungus growing on the root system of a plant, Pleurotus (or oyster mushroom mycelium), and Serpula (the dry rot found fruiting in the oven at Haddon Hall).

It is a question that came to preoccupy Lucy Gilbert and David Johnson, then working at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland. To find out, they set up a deft experiment. Broad bean plants were either allowed to connect to a shared mycorrhizal network or prevented from doing so using a fine nylon mesh. The mesh allowed water and chemicals to pass, but prevented direct contact between the fungi connected to different plants. Once the plants had grown, aphids were allowed to attack the leaves of one of the plants in the network. Plastic bags placed over the plants prevented the transmission of infochemicals through the air.<br/>			 Gilbert and Johnson found clear confirmation of their hypothesis. Plants that were connected to the aphid-infested plant via a shared fungal network ramped up their production of volatile defense compounds, even though they had not encountered the aphids themselves. The plumes of volatile compounds produced by the plants were large enough to attract the parasitic wasps, suggesting that information passing between the plants through the fungal channel could make a difference in a real-world setting. Gilbert described this to me as a “completely new” finding. It revealed a previously unknown role for shared mycorrhizal networks. Not only could a donor plant influence a receiver but its influence could leak out beyond the receiver in the form of volatile chemicals. A shared mycorrhizal network influenced not only the relationship between two plants but also the relationship between two plants, their aphid pests, and their wasp allies.<br/>			<br/>			 Since 2013, it has become clear that Gilbert and Johnson’s finding isn’t an anomaly.

<td>You think the world is what it looks like in fine weather at noon day,” the philosopher Alfred North Whitehead once observed to his former student Bertrand Russell. “I think it is what it seems like in the early morning when one first wakes from deep sleep.” In Whitehead’s terms, Dawkins speculates in fine weather at noon day. He takes pains to ensure that his speculation about extended phenotypes remains “disciplined” and “tightly limited.” He is clear that phenotypes can extend beyond the body, but they can’t be too extended. By contrast, McKenna speculates at dawn. His requirements are less stringent, his explanations less tightly limited. Between the two poles lies a continent of possible opinion.<br/></td>

<td>	 A plant’s fungal partners can have a noticeable impact on its growth—and its flesh. A number of years ago, at a conference on mycorrhizal relationships, I met a researcher who had been growing strawberry plants with different communities of mycorrhizal fungus. The experiment was simple. If the same species of strawberry was grown with different species of fungus, would the flavor of the strawberries change? He conducted blind taste tests and found that different fungal communities did seem to change the flavor of the fruit. Some had more flavor, some were juicier, some were sweeter.<br/>			 When he repeated the experiment a second year running, unpredictable weather swamped the effects of mycorrhizal fungi on the taste of the strawberries, but a number of other striking effects surfaced. Bumblebees were more attracted to the flowers of strawberry plants grown with some fungal species and less attracted to others. Plants grown with some mycorrhizal species produced more berries than others. And the appearance of the berries changed depending on which fungi they partnered with. Some mycorrhizal communities made the berries look more appealing, some less so.<br/>			 Strawberries aren’t alone in being sensitive to the identity of their fungal partners. Most plants—from a potted snapdragon to a giant sequoia—will develop differently when grown with different communities of mycorrhizal fungus. Basil plants, for example, produce different profiles of the aromatic oils that make up their flavor when grown with different mycorrhizal strains. Some fungi have been found to make tomatoes sweeter than others; some change the essential oil profile of fennel, coriander, and mint; some increase the concentration of iron and carotenoids in lettuce leaves, the antioxidant activity in artichoke heads, or the concentrations of medicinal compounds in Saint-John’s-wort and echinacea. In 2013, a team of Italian researchers baked loaves of bread using wheat that had been grown with different mycorrhizal communities. The bread was subjected to testing with an electronic nose and a tasting panel consisting of ten “well-trained testers” at the University of Gastronomic Sciences in Bra, Italy. (Each tester, the authors assert reassuringly, “had a minimum of two years’ experience in sensory evaluation.”) Surprisingly, given how many stages occur between harvest and tasting—milling, mixing, and baking, besides the addition of yeast—both the panel and the electronic nose were able to tell the loaves apart. The bread grown with an enhanced mycorrhizal fungal community had a higher “flavor intensity” and improved “elasticity and crumbliness.” By smelling a flower, by chewing on twigs, leaves, or bark, by drinking a wine, how many other aspects of a plant’s mycorrhizal underground might we be able to taste? I often wonder.<br/></td>

<td>Does it matter? Much of the story of agriculture is one of ecological sacrifice. Forests are cleared to make way for fields. Hedgerows are cleared to make way for bigger fields. Surely it is the same with the communities of microbes in the soil? If humans feed crops by adding fertilizer to fields, don’t we take over the job of mycorrhizal fungi? Why care about the fungi if we have made them redundant?<br/>			 Mycorrhizal fungi do more than feed plants. The researchers at Agroscope describe them as keystone organisms but some prefer the term “ecosystem engineers.” Mycorrhizal mycelium is a sticky living seam that holds soil together; remove the fungi, and the ground washes away. Mycorrhizal fungi increase the volume of water that the soil can absorb, reducing the quantity of nutrients leached out of the soil by rainfall by as much as fifty percent. Of the carbon that is found in soils—which, remarkably, amounts to twice the amount of carbon found in plants and the atmosphere combined—a substantial proportion is bound up in tough organic compounds produced by mycorrhizal fungi. The carbon that floods into the soil through mycorrhizal channels supports intricate food webs. Besides the hundreds or thousands of meters of fungal mycelium in a teaspoon of healthy soil, there are more bacteria, protists, insects, and arthropods than the number of humans who have ever lived on Earth.<br/></td>

<td>African Macrotermes termites are some of the more striking examples. Macrotermes, like most termites, spend much of their lives foraging for wood, although they aren’t able to eat it. Instead, the termites cultivate a white rot fungus—Termitomyces—that digests it for them. The termites chew wood into a slurry that they regurgitate in fungal gardens, known as the “fungus comb,” by contrast with bees’ honeycomb. The fungus uses radical chemistry to decompose the wood. The termites consume the compost that remains. To house the fungus, Macrotermes build towering mounds that reach heights of nine meters, some of which are more than two thousand years old. Societies of Macrotermes termites, like those of leaf-cutter ants, are some of the most complex formed by any insect group.</td>

Sometimes, as Sam Gamgee found, introducing plants to a community of soil microbes can support the growth of crops and trees and help restore life to devastated soils. However, the success of this approach depends on the ecological fit. Poorly matched mycorrhizal species might do more harm to plants than good. Worse, introducing opportunistic fungal species to new environments might displace local fungal strains with unknown ecological consequences.

Each woman sings a different melody; each voice tells a different musical story. Many melodies intertwine without ceasing to be many. Voices flow around other voices, twisting into and beside one another.<br/>			 “Women Gathering Mushrooms” is an example of musical polyphony.

Lichen samples exposed to six kilograys of gamma irradiation—six times the standard dose for food sterilization in the United States and twelve thousand times the lethal dose for humans—were entirely untroubled.

<td>Charles Darwin, writing in 1871, took a pragmatic line. “Intelligence is based on how efficient a species becomes at doing the things they need to survive.” It is a perspective that has been echoed by many contemporary biologists and philosophers. The Latin root of the word intelligence means “to choose between.” Many types of brainless organisms—plants, fungi, and slime molds included—respond to their environments in flexible ways, solve problems, and make decisions between alternative courses of action. Complex information processing is evidently not restricted to the inner workings of brains. Some use the term “swarm intelligence” to describe the problem-solving behavior of brainless systems. Others suggest that the behavior of these network-based life-forms can be thought of as arising from “minimal” or “basal” cognition, and argue that the question we should ask is not whether an organism has cognition or not. Rather, we should assess the degree to which an organism might be cognizant. In all these views, intelligent behaviors can arise without brains.

By far the most prolific group are the white rot fungi—so-called because in decomposition they bleach wood a pale color. Most enzymes—biological catalysts that living organisms use to conduct chemical reactions—lock onto specific molecular shapes. Faced with lignin, this approach is hopeless; its chemical structure is too irregular. White rot fungi work around the problem using nonspecific enzymes that don’t depend on shape. These “peroxidases” release a torrent of highly reactive molecules, known as “free radicals,” which crack open lignin’s tightly bonded structure in a process known as “enzymatic combustion.”</td>

<td>Piedmont white truffles and other prized mycorrhizal fungi, such as porcini, chanterelle, and matsutake, have never been domesticated in part because of the fluidity of their relationships with plants, and in part because of the intricacies of their sex lives. There are too many gaps in our understanding of how basic fungal communication happens. Some truffle species can be cultivated, such as the Périgord black, but trufficulture is immature by comparison with the venerable craft surrounding most human agricultural efforts, and even the success of seasoned cultivators can vary wildly. At Lefevre’s New World Truffieres, the proportion of seedlings that grow successfully with the mycelium of the Périgord black truffle hovers around thirty percent. One year, with no deliberate change in method, he achieved a one hundred percent success rate. “I have not been able to reproduce that result,” he told me. “I don’t know what I did right.”<br/>			<br/>			 To cultivate truffles effectively, you have to understand the quirks and needs not only of the fungi—with their idiosyncratic reproductive systems—but also of the trees and bacteria they live with. Moreover, you have to understand the importance of subtle variations in the surrounding soil, season, and climate. “It is an intellectually stimulating field because it’s so interdisciplinary,” Ulf Büntgen, a professor of geography at Cambridge, and the first to report the fruiting of a Périgord black truffle in the British Isles, told me. “It is microbiology, physiology, land management, agriculture, forestry, ecology, economy, and climate change.

<td>Intrigued by these questions, and having read Thomas Piketty’s work on wealth inequality in human societies, Kiers began thinking about the role of inequality within fungal networks. She and her team exposed a single mycorrhizal fungus to an unequal supply of phosphorus. One part of the mycelium had access to a big patch of phosphorus. Another part had access to a small patch. She was interested in how this would affect the fungus’s trading decisions in different parts of the same network. Some recognizable patterns emerged. In parts of a mycelial network where phosphorus was scarce, the plant paid a higher “price,” supplying more carbon to the fungus for every unit of phosphorus it received. Where phosphorus was more readily available, the fungus received a less favorable “exchange rate.” The “price” of phosphorus seemed to be governed by the familiar dynamics of supply and demand.<br/>			<br/>			 Most surprising was the way that the fungus coordinated its trading behavior across the network. Kiers identified a strategy of “buy low, sell high.” The fungus actively transported phosphorus—using its dynamic microtubule “motors”—from areas of abundance, where it fetched a low price when exchanged with a plant root, to areas of scarcity, where it was in higher demand and fetched a higher price. By doing so, the fungus was able to transfer a greater proportion of its phosphorus to the plant at the more favorable exchange rate, thus receiving larger quantities of carbon in return.<br/>			 How are these behaviors controlled? Can the fungus detect differences in exchange rate across its network and actively transport phosphorus to play the system? Or does it always transport phosphorus within its network from areas of abundance to areas of scarcity, sometimes receiving a payoff from the plant, and sometimes not? We still don’t know. Nonetheless, Kiers’s studies illuminate some of the intricacies of plant and fungal exchange, and show how solutions to complex challenges are able to emerge. All of these behaviors illustrate a general pattern. How a given plant or fungus behaves depends on who they find themselves partnering with and where they happen to be. One can think of mycorrhizal relationships as stretched along a continuum, with parasites at one pole and cooperative mutualists at the other. Some plants benefit from their fungal partners under some conditions and not under others. Grow plants with plenty of phosphorus, and they might become less picky about which fungal </td>

<td>Thirteen years later, in 1997, a Canadian PhD student, Suzanne Simard, published the first study suggesting that carbon could pass between plants in a natural setting. Simard exposed pairs of tree seedlings growing in a forest to radioactive carbon dioxide. After two years, she found that carbon had passed from birch trees to fir trees, which shared a mycorrhizal network, but not between birch and cedar, which didn’t. The amount of carbon obtained by the fir trees—on average six percent of the labeled carbon taken up by the birch—was, by Simard’s reckoning, a meaningful transfer: Over time, one would expect this to make a difference to the life of the trees. What’s more, when fir seedlings were shaded—which limited photosynthesis and deprived them of their supply of carbon—they received more carbon from their birch donors than when they were unshaded. Carbon seemed to flow “downhill” between plants, from plenty to scarcity.</td>

<td>Kiers’s findings are surprising because they suggest that neither plant nor fungus is in complete control of the relationship. Between them, they are able to strike compromises, resolve trade-offs, and deploy sophisticated trading strategies. In one set of experiments, she found that plant roots were able to supply carbon preferentially to fungal strains that provided them with more phosphorus. In return, fungi that received more carbon from the plant supplied it with yet more phosphorus. Exchange was in some sense negotiated between the two depending on the availability of resources. Kiers hypothesized that these “reciprocal rewards” have helped to keep plant and fungal associations stable over evolutionary time. Because both partners share control of the exchange, neither partner would be able to hijack the relationship for their own exclusive benefit.<br/>			<br/>			 Although both plants and fungi tend to benefit from the relationship overall, different species of plant and fungus have different symbiotic manners. Some fungi make more cooperative partners; some are less cooperative and will “hoard” phosphorus rather than exchange it with their plant partners. However, even a hoarder might not hoard all the time. Their behavior is flexible, a set of ongoing negotiations that depend on what is taking place around them and in other parts of themselves. We don’t know much about the workings of these behaviors, but it’s clear that at any one moment plants and fungi face a number of options. And options entail choices, however those choices turn out to be made—whether in a conscious human mind, an unconscious computer algorithm, or anything in between.<br/>			 Are plants and fungi making decisions, albeit brainless ones, I wondered. “I use the word decision all the time,” Kiers told me. “There’s a set of options, and somehow information has to be integrated and one of the options has to be chosen. I think that a lot of what we are doing is studying micro-scale decisions.” There are many ways that these choices could unfold. “Are there absolute decisions being made in every hyphal tip?” Kiers mused. “Or is it all relative, in which case what happens would depend on what else is happening across the network.”<br/></td>

<td>How best to distribute their bodies is a question fungi face on a moment-to-moment basis. By growing a dense network, mycelium can increase its capacity for transport, but dense networks aren’t good for exploring across large distances. Sparse networks are better for foraging across large areas but have fewer interconnections and so are more vulnerable to damage. How do fungi juggle this kind of trade-off while exploring a crowded rotscape in search of food?<br/>			 Boddy’s experiment with two blocks of wood illustrates a typical sequence of events. The mycelium starts in an exploratory mode, proliferating in all directions. Setting out to find water in a desert, we’d have to pick one direction to explore. Fungi can choose all possible routes at once. If the fungus discovers something to eat, it reinforces the links that connect it with the food and prunes back the links that don’t lead anywhere. One can think of it in terms of natural selection. Mycelium overproduces links. Some turn out to be more competitive than others. These links are thickened. Less competitive links are withdrawn, leaving a few mainline highways. By growing in one direction while pulling back from another, mycelial networks can even migrate through a landscape. The Latin root of the word extravagant means “to wander outside or beyond.” It is a good word for mycelium, which ceaselessly wanders outside and beyond its limits, none of which are preset as they are in most animal bodies. Mycelium is a body without a body plan.</td>

A win for the waste-producer, a win for the cultivator, and a win for the fungi. The inefficiency of many industries is a blessing to mushroom growers.

<td> fungi could use electrical signaling as a basis for rapid communication has not been lost on Andrew Adamatzky, the director of the Unconventional Computing Laboratory. In 2018, he inserted electrodes into whole oyster mushrooms sprouting in clusters from blocks of mycelium and detected spontaneous waves of electrical activity. When he held a flame up to a mushroom, different mushrooms within the cluster responded with a sharp electrical spike. Shortly afterward, he published a paper called “Towards fungal computer.” In it, he proposed that mycelial networks “compute” information encoded in spikes of electrical activity. If we knew how a mycelial network would respond to a given stimulus, Adamatzky argues, we could treat it like a living circuit board. By stimulating the mycelium—for example, using a flame or a chemical—we could input data into the fungal computer.<br/>			<br/>			 A fungal computer may sound fantastical, but biocomputing is a fast-growing field. Adamatzky has spent years developing ways to use slime molds as sensors and computers. These prototype biocomputers use slime molds to solve a range of geometrical problems. The slime mold networks can be modified—for instance, by cutting a connection—to alter the set of “logical functions” implemented by the network. Adamatzky’s idea of a “fungal computer” is just an application of slime-mold computing to another type of network-based organism.<br/>			 As Adamatzky observes, the mycelial networks of some species of fungus are more convenient for computing than slime molds.

She then placed the block on a dish. Mycelium spread radially outward from the block in all directions, forming a fuzzy white circle. Eventually the growing network encountered a new block of wood. Only a small part of the fungus touched the wood, but the behavior of the entire network changed. The mycelium stopped exploring in all directions.

<td>This wasn’t the only clone. The director informed us that there were two more: one on the site of Newton’s alchemical laboratory, at the front of Trinity College, and the other outside the math faculty. (It later transpired that there are even more—in the president’s garden at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, among other places.) The myth was strong enough to make three separate academic committees—known for their caution and indecision above all else—decide to plant the trees in auspicious places around the town. All the while, the official position remained unchanged: The story of Newton’s apple was apocryphal and had no basis in firm fact.<br/>			 As botanical theater goes, it doesn’t get much better.

However, there are several versions of the story recorded by Newton’s contemporaries. The most detailed account was written by William Stukeley, a young fellow of the Royal Society and antiquarian best-known today for his works on Britain’s stone circles. In 1726, Stukeley recalled, he and Newton ate together in London:<br/>			 <br/>				 After dinner, the weather being warm, we went into the garden &amp; drank thea under the shade of some apple tree; only he &amp; myself…Amid other discourse, he told me, he was just in the same situation, as when formerly the notion of gravitation came into his mind. Why shd that apple always descend perpendicularly to the ground, thought he to himself; occasion’d by the fall of an apple, as he sat in contemplative mood. Why shd it not go sideways, or upward? But constantly to the Earth’s center? Assuredly the reason is, that the Earth draws it. There must be a drawing power in matter.<br/>			<br/>			 The modern story of Newton’s apple is a story about a story about what Newton said. This is what made the trees so narratively rich. It was impossible to verify the story either way. In response to this quandary, the academics acted as if it were both true and false. The story shuttled in and out of legend. The trees were saddled with an impossible narrative, an example of the way nonhuman organisms stretch the seams of our categories to breaking point. Whether an apple had actually inspired Newton to derive his theory of gravitation had long ceased to matter. The trees grew; the story thrived.<br/></td>

<td>N THE CARBONIFEROUS period, 290 to 360 million years ago, the earliest wood-producing plants spread across the tropics in swampy forests, supported by their mycorrhizal fungal partners. These forests grew and died, pulling huge quantities of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. And for tens of millions of years, much of this plant matter didn’t decompose. Layers of dead and un-rotted forest built up, storing so much carbon that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels crashed, and the planet entered a period of global cooling. Plants had caused the climate crisis, and plants were hit the hardest by it: Huge areas of tropical forest were wiped out in an extinction event known as the Carboniferous rainforest collapse.

Dehydration also protects them from the most hazardous consequence of cosmic rays: highly reactive free radicals, produced when radiation cleaves water molecules in two, that damage the structure of DNA.<br/>			 Dormancy appears to be the most important survival strategy for lichens, but they have others.

<td>To minimize the stress from threatened relationships, a person may give up some part of his autonomy. However, this is not a formula for health, since the loss of autonomy is itself a cause of stress. The surrender of autonomy raises the stress level, even if on the surface it appears to be necessary for the sake of “security” in a relationship, and even if we subjectively feel relief when we gain “security” in this manner. If I chronically repress my emotional needs in order to make myself “acceptable” to other people, I increase my risks of having to pay the price in the form of illness.<br/>			The other way of protecting oneself from the stress of threatened relationships is emotional shutdown. To feel safe, the vulnerable person withdraws from others and closes against intimacy. This coping style may avoid anxiety and block the subjective experience of stress but not the physiology of it. Emotional intimacy is a psychological and biological necessity. Those who build walls against intimacy are not self-regulated, just emotionally frozen. Their stress from having unmet needs will be high.</td>

<td>GIVEN THE INFORMATION PRESENTED IN previous chapters, it may seem as though parents are to blame for the later development of illness in their offspring. Such a conclusion is quite contrary to my intentions and entirely out of keeping with the scientific evidence. Parenting styles do not reflect greater or lesser degrees of love in the heart of the mother and father; other, more mundane factors are at play. Parental love is infinite and for a very practical reason: the selfless nurturing of the young is embedded in the attachment apparatus of the mammalian brain.<br/>			If a parent’s loving feelings are constricted, it only because that parent has himself or herself suffered deep hurt. In my work with drug addicts in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside, I treat many substance-dependent men and women. Hardened as they are—with their criminal records, their continued drug-seeking, their HIV infections and their harassed and socially marginal lives—the deepest pain they all have is about the children whom they have abandoned or who have been taken from them. Without exception, they themselves were abused or abandoned in childhood.<br/>			Where parenting fails to communicate unconditional acceptance to the child, it is because of the fact that the child receives the parent’s love not as the parent wishes but as it is refracted through the parent’s personality. If the parent is stressed, harbours unresolved anxiety or is agitated by unmet emotional needs, the child is likely to find herself in situations of proximate abandonment regardless of the parent’s intentions.<br/>			</td>

<td>The baby’s response to the returning mother, it turned out, was programmed by how the mother had interacted with her during the first year of life. Those infants who had received attuned attention from their mothers at home showed signs of missing their mothers on separation. They greeted their returning mothers by initiating physical contact. They were soothed easily and returned quickly to spontaneous play. This pattern was called secure. There were also a number of insecure patterns, variously named avoidant, ambivalent or disorganized. Avoidant infants did not express distress on separating from the mother and avoided or ignored the mother on reunion. Such behaviour did not denote genuine self-reliance but the pseudo-autonomy that we noted, for example, in rheumatoid patients: the belief that they must depend only on themselves, since trying to obtain help from the parent was useless. Internally, however, these avoidant infants were physiologically stressed when the parent returned, as measured by heart rate changes. The infants falling into the insecure categories had been subjected to non-attuned parenting in the home. They had received implicit messages of maternal emotional absence, or mixed messages of contact alternating with distance.</td>

The intended meaning of words reflect only the speaker’s conscious beliefs, from which painful memories are often excluded.

Adaptiveness is the capacity to respond to external stressors without rigidity, with flexibility and creativity, without excessive anxiety and without being overwhelmed by emotion. People who are not adaptive may seem to function well as long as nothing is disturbing them, but they will react with various levels of frustration and helplessness when confronted by loss or by difficulty. They will blame themselves or blame others. A person’s adaptiveness depends very much on the degree of differentiation and adaptiveness of previous generations in his family and also on what external stressors may have acted on the family. The Great Depression, for example, was a difficult time for millions of people. The multigenerational history of particular families enabled some to adapt and cope, while other families, facing the same economic scarcities, were psychologically devastated.<br/>			“Highly adaptive people and families, on the average, have fewer physical illnesses, and those illnesses that do occur tend to be mild to moderate in severity,” writes Dr. Michael Kerr.<br/>			Since one important variable in the development of physical illness is the degree of adaptiveness of an individual, and since the degree of adaptiveness is determined by the multigenerational emotional process, physical illness, like emotional illness, is a symptom of a relationship process that extends beyond the boundaries of the individual “patient.” Physical illness, in other words, is a disorder of the family emotional system [which includes] present and past generations.</td>

Now we see that concepts such as “the rheumatoid personality” or “the cancer personality” are misleading for yet another reason: they assume that an individual person is an isolated entity, not recognizing that he is situated in and shaped by a multigenerational family system. As Dr. Kerr suggests, it is much more illuminating to think of, say, a cancer position than a cancer personality. “The concept of a cancer personality, although certainly having some validity, is based in individual theories of human functioning. The concept of a cancer position is based in a systems theory of human functioning.

<td>No disease has a single cause. Even where significant risks can be identified—such as biological heredity in some autoimmune diseases or smoking in lung cancer—these vulnerabilities do not exist in isolation. Personality also does not by itself cause disease: one does not get cancer simply from repressing anger or ALS just from being too nice. A systems model recognizes that many processes and factors work together in the formation of disease or in the creation of health. We have demonstrated in this book a biopsychosocial model of medicine. According to the biopsychosocial view, individual biology reflects the history of a human organism in lifelong interaction with an environment, a perpetual interchange of energy in which psychological and social factors are as vital as physical ones. As Dr. Gelmon suggests, healing is a phenomenon of finding balance and harmony.<br/>			We cannot remind ourselves too</td>

<td>That which is complete may become deficient in two possible ways: something could be subtracted from it, or its internal harmony could be so perturbed that the parts that worked together no longer do so. As we have seen, stress is a disturbance of the body’s internal balance in response to perceived threat, including the threat of some essential need being denied. Physical hunger may be one such deprivation, but in our society the threat is most often psychic, such as the withdrawal of emotional nourishment or the disruption of psychological harmony.<br/>			“I cannot understand why I have cancer,” one woman with ovarian cancer said. “I’ve led a healthy life, eaten well, exercised regularly. I’ve always taken good care of myself. If anyone should be a picture of health, it’s me.” The area she overlooked was invisible to her: the stress connected with emotional repression. Her conscientious (and conscious) best efforts to look after herself properly could not extend to an arena she did not know existed. That is why knowledge and insight have the power to transform, and why insight is more helpful to people than advice. If we gain the ability to look into ourselves with honesty, compassion and with unclouded vision, we can identify the ways we need to take care of ourselves. We can see the areas of the self formerly hidden in the dark.<br/>			The potential for wholeness, for health, resides in all of us, as does the potential for illness and disharmony. Disease is disharmony. More accurately, it is an expression of an internal disharmony. If illness is seen as foreign and external, we may end up waging war against ourselves.<br/>			</td>

My younger sister was just eight months old and very colicky. None of us got much attention but what little there was my sister got. We were shuffled around from place to place, because my father was a travelling salesman. Within a year he married somebody who looked a lot like my mother. She was the Wicked Witch of the West. She had her own problems. She was awful to us. Finally, she sent us away to a French-Canadian convent.<br/>			“She didn’t like children—she was the eldest of fourteen children and had raised all her younger brothers and sisters. She couldn’t wait to get out of her home. She rose to be a secretary at the Canadian embassy in Costa Rica. She was a very bright woman, but at thirty-three she was becoming a spinster. My father apparently asked every available woman in the English-speaking community of Costa Rica to marry him within the year after my mom’s death, and they all said no. She said yes—she didn’t want children, she didn’t like children, but that was her pact with the devil. And my dad? He was at home fifty-two days the first year they were married. Here she was with three little girls who had all these communicable diseases, one after the other, quarantined. I certainly see her side of it.<br/>			“I remember copying out French poems and leaving them outside the bathroom door when she was in there having a shower. She never, ever responded to them.

<td>Animals and young humans are highly competent at picking up on real emotional cues. If we lose that capacity as we acquire language, it is only because we receive confusing messages from our immediate world. The words we hear tell us one thing, the emotional data say something different. If the two are in conflict, one will be repressed. In the same way, when a child’s eyes diverge, the brain will suppress images from one eye in order to avoid double vision. The suppressed eye, unless corrected, will become blind. We repress our emotional intelligence in order to avoid an ongoing war with the crucial people in our lives, a war we cannot possibly win. And so we lose our emotional competence even as we gain verbal intelligence. Aphasiacs, it would appear, go through the reverse process. Much as a blind person will develop an extraordinary capacity to hear, the aphasiac develops an enhanced ability to perceive emotional reality.</td>

If in repression the problem is a lack of release, acting out consists of an equally abnormal suppression of release alternating with unregulated and exaggerated venting.

<td>I found Kalpin’s description of genuine anger surprising, even as it rang completely true to me. His explanation made me realize the confusion in our commonly received ideas about this emotion. Healthy anger, he says, is an empowerment and a relaxation. The real experience of anger “is physiologic experience without acting out. The experience is one of a surge of power going through the system, along with a mobilization to attack. There is, simultaneously, a complete disappearance of all anxiety.<br/>			“When healthy anger is starting to be experienced, you don’t see anything dramatic. What you do see is a decrease of all muscle tension. The mouth is opening wider, because the jaws are more relaxed, the voice is lower in pitch because the vocal cords are more relaxed.

Sure, you could tell them there’s a superstorm coming that might destroy your home and everything you know, and anyone who doesn’t get to shelter will probably be dead by morning.

When the Krakau fall on your lubricating fluid, they’ll impale themselves.”<br/>			“Not bad.” Wolf had been less than thrilled at having to babysit the Prodryan, but the idea of setting traps for the Krakau had brought out a new, slightly less obnoxious side to Cate’s personality. “If these door controls still worked, we could probably rig a tripwire to bring one down on the first Krakau through.”<br/>			“A trick almost worthy of a Prodryan,” said Cate.<br/>			Wolf stopped halfway down the stairs and activated her cutting torch, setting a narrow three-centimeter flame. She cut at an angle through the handrail, just past the top bracket holding it to the wall.<br/>			“Improvised spikes!” Cate’s antennae rose, and he leaned closer. “Excellent!”<br/>			“Not spikes.” Wolf made a second cut right before bracket number two, at the opposite angle. She lifted the rail free while the metal cooled, then set it gently back. The beveled angles held the rail in place, but the slightest tug would pull it free. She swapped the torch for her spray wand and began coating the next set of steps. “After they recover from level one, the Krakau will be expecting the oiled stairs.

Another had a damaged airflow vent in her quarters but neglected to report it until the walls were covered in Earth mold.”<br/>			“How many sanibombs did that take?” asked Mops.<br/>			“Bombs are on backorder. I had to tear down the walls to get that place properly cleaned and sanitized.”<br/>			“I’d been on the Pufferfish for two months when Infantry Team 4 got hold of two bottles of Prodryan honey wine,” said Mops. “They snuck into the combat bridge and spent the night celebrating.

<td>Throughout recorded Prodryan history, twelve Supreme War Leaders have commanded the loyalty of all clans. Each one united their people during a time of exceptional chaos or opportunity. None have had as broad or long-lasting an impact on Prodryan culture as the first.<br/>			In typical Prodryan nomenclature, the first Supreme War Leader of Yan went by the name “Supreme War Leader.” History describes him as a prodigy, born nine hundred years ago in a remote hive in the icy wastelands of Yan’s southernmost continent. The only survivor of a barbarian raid, Supreme War Leader set out on a mission of vengeance at the age of eleven. For three years, he tracked and slaughtered those responsible for the attack on his home.<br/>			During this time, he revolutionized military tactics and invented seven new distance weapons, including the barbed bola and the wing spear. His poetry from this period was collected and published as Supreme War Poems, Part 1, and remains on the Prodryan bestseller list to this day.<br/>			By the time Supreme War Leader finished his mission of vengeance, he had gained many disciples, drawn by his tactical genius and innate charisma. He spent the following eight years traveling the world at the head of this personal army, bringing law and order and civilization to the surrounding lands. Early battles were difficult, but as his reputation and his army grew, other clans surrendered more quickly. Soon, Prodryans were eager to submit to his leadership.<br/>			At the age of twenty-four, Supreme War Leader received his name and title by a unanimous vote of Yan’s surviving clan leaders. (Six clan leaders voted against him, but they were promptly killed, so are not included as survivors.)<br/>			</td>

As such, the default assumption is that the superior has no obligation to the inferior.”<br/>			“Are you suggesting I am inferior?” demanded Guardian.<br/>			“It’s not a suggestion.” Cate gently massaged the base of his antennae. “The contract explicitly says so in Section four, Paragraph two.

He’d taken Mops’ chair, but couldn’t sit comfortably since it wasn’t built for Prodryan wings and exoskeleton. As a result, he had to crouch on the front edge, teetering precariously in the seat of power. “Your contract specifies certain prerequisites, including a minimal level of competence as a warrior. I propose we demonstrate your incompetence.”<br/>			“Insult me again, and I’ll rip the wings from your back,” Guardian snarled.<br/>			“Thus proving your prowess as a warrior and condemning you to serve out the remainder of your contract,” Cate said smoothly. “The duration of which is . . .”<br/>			“Six more years.”<br/>			“You foolish, foolish man.” Cate clicked his mandibles in amusement. “Six more years, with an optional extension that can be exercised by your employer as many times as they like.”<br/>			Guardian’s wings slashed out. “What?”<br/>			“See Section twenty-three. According to this, they can choose to keep you here for the rest of your natural life.” Cate paused, double-checking something on his console. “On the bright side, it also says you’re entitled to a half-percent pay raise with each ten-year extension, assuming you pass your performance review.”<br/>			Slowly, Guardian sagged. His wings drooped, and his antennae fell limply over his brow. He looked like his armor was about to slough from his body. Mops had never seen a Prodryan appear so utterly defeated.<br/>			“How do we prove my incompetence?” he asked.<br/>			Cate made a show of reviewing his notes before answering. “According to the contract, your primary responsibility is to keep all unauthorized ships away from Hell’s Claws.

Whatever you and your team intend to do down there, do it fast.”<br/>			“Understood.” Kumar stared at Mops. “Captain, you know I never wanted—”<br/>			“I know, sir.”<br/>			He flinched at that last word, but as Mops spoke, she felt an unexpected sense of relief.

<td>much for checkers.” Monroe watched the short-range fighters close on the Pufferfish. Three sets of three ships. Typical Prodryan approach. One group would probably attack head-on, while the other two hit from the sides. “Johnny, it’s time!”<br/>			“Excellent!” Johnny’s tentacles reached over Rubin’s shoulders to prep the A-rings. “Grom, I’ll require your assistance. Rubin, keep our beak pointed at the center ships.”<br/>			Rubin shoved a tentacle aside and adjusted the controls, turning the Pufferfish until the ship faced directly away from the planet.<br/>			Monroe activated a communications channel. “Swift Death, this is Commander Monroe. If you shoot us down, you’ll never have the chance to redeem your zero-and-four checkers record.”<br/>			There was no response. Not that he’d expected one. He’d already dragged those games out longer than he’d hoped.<br/>			“Launching A-rings now,” said Johnny. “First four rings are away. Preparing rings five through eight.”<br/>			“Not yet,” shouted Grom. “Let me get these anchored into position first.”<br/>			Even four rings were three more than anyone was supposed to deploy at one time. Johnny and Grom had been working tirelessly to split off the controls that maneuvered and locked the rings into place. It meant reducing power and precision to the grav beams, but so far, it appeared to be working.<br/>			The four rings slowly expanded to their maximum diameter, wide enough for the Pufferfish to pass through.<br/>			“Spinning rings one through four up to three percent power,” said Johnny. “We could go as high as five percent before the gravity from Tuxatl and its sun interferes, but I’d rather not push it.”<br/>			“By all means,” agreed Monroe. “Let’s stick with one potentially disastrous experiment at a time.”<br/>			Swift Death’s voice crackled over the speakers. “We are familiar with Captain Adamopoulos’ tactics, Commander Monroe. Using your A-rings to try to hurl Prodryan missiles back at our ships will not save you.”<br/>			“Rubin, can we pinpoint where Swift Death is broadcasting from?” asked Monroe.<br/>			Rubin shook her head. “I don’t know how to do that, sir.”<br/>			“You have no weapons,” Swift Death continued. “This is your final chance to surrender. Turn over the Pufferfish and I promise you and your crew several additional hours of life.”<br/>			Monroe studied the incoming ships. Swift Death was new to this assignment and needed to prove herself. A cautious attacker would hold back and let their missiles soften up the Pufferfish.<br/>			But Swift Death had been an aggressive checkers player. She’d want an impressive victory, and that meant getting nice and close.<br/>			“They’re warming up energy weapons,” said Grom.<br/>			“They know we’re unarmed.” Monroe tagged the three central ships. “Grom, Johnny, you have your targets.”<br/>			Grom maneuvered A-ring one, while Johnny launched a fifth ring, this one designated one-beta. She expanded one-beta to eighty percent of its maximum diameter, then nudged the grav beams, sending it forward.<br/>			“Is this actually going to work?” asked Grom.<br/>			Johnny shrugged a tentacle and spun up one-beta to three percent power. “Fuck if I know.”<br/>			The first round of Prodryan fire crackled over the Pufferfish’s hull.<br/>			“Time to find out.” Monroe watched the smaller ring move closer and closer to the larger, active ring, like one checker placed atop another. “King me.”<br/>			Ring one-beta passed through ring one. The larger ring instantly accelerated the smaller, launching it at a modest twenty percent of light speed toward the first of the incoming fighters.<br/>			In theory, according to Johnny’s calculations, one-beta should have then accelerated the fighter away from the Pufferfish at that same 0.2c speed.<br/>			Instead, the fighter vanished in an explosion that sent a circle of debris slamming into the other two ships in its formation. A-ring one destabilized and exploded seconds later.<br/>			Monroe blinked. “What just happened?”<br/>			“I believe one-beta was half a degree off course,” said Johnny. “It may have caught on the fighter instead of passing cleanly around it. It accelerated half of the ship into the other half.”<br/>			“Good enough for me. How soon can we launch two-beta?”<br/>			Grom checked their screen. “The remaining fighters are veering away. We have a window to strike before they send reinforcements.”<br/>			“This madness would never be permitted on a Krakau-controlled ship.” Johnny whistled with excitement. “I love this mission!”</td>

To my right is Starfallen, formerly called Wartalker, Wing Guard for the Crimson Warlord, Victor of Sharise, Muiniar, Plikxit IV, and countless other battles. We address you from the EDFS Pufferfish, under command of the human called Marilyn Monroe. These two Jynx are Argarrar and Jagar, natives of the planet below, the same world where Starfallen was shamefully abandoned and left to die. Thanks to my advice and guidance, we successfully retrieved this great warrior from Hell’s Claws.”<br/>			Years of military discipline allowed Monroe to keep a straight face, but it was a close thing.<br/>			“During this rescue, Starfallen and I uncovered a plot against all Prodryans,” Cate continued. “A threat which even our unmatched military strength and cultural superiority was unprepared to fight.”<br/>			“The power that controls Hell’s Claws . . . changed me,” said Starfallen. “It altered my brain, removing my instincts for aggression and rendering me . . . peaceful.”<br/>			“Our leaders knew of this atrocity.” The translator managed to capture the horror in Cate’s words. “They knew the threat this world presented to our people, and how did they respond? Did they fight like true Prodryans? No. They ran away. They abandoned one of our greatest heroes. They created a blockade around the planet and worked to bury the truth like scavengers covering their pellets. Because of this criminal neglect, the crew of the Pufferfish was able to procure a sample of this biological weapon of mass destruction, one which would turn all Prodryans from predators to prey.”<br/>			“Perhaps our new Supreme War Leader was ignorant of the danger of Hell’s Claws,” said Starfallen. “Or perhaps he was content to continue the policies of the past, to cower like a hatchling in a thunderstorm.”<br/>			“Whether guilty of ignorance or cowardice, he is unfit to rule our mighty race.” Cate spread his wings to emphasize his words.<br/>			On the tactical display, the Destiny and the rest of the Prodryan ships were changing course. Monroe was unsurprised to see them accelerating toward the Pufferfish.<br/>			Cate stepped forward. “While lesser Prodryans scurried about, fighting the Krakau and their allies, I faced the true threat to our people. I—with the help of Captain Marion Adamopoulos of the Pufferfish—sought out the rulers of this world, the would-be architects of our destruction: Jynx like Speaker Argarrar, who sits before you.”<br/>			Had Cate just shared credit with a human? Monroe glanced over at Kumar, who looked equally stunned. Even Grom appeared surprised, their limbs hanging loosely about their face.<br/>			Argarrar stretched and yawned.<br/>			“In order to continue to protect the Prodryan people and our worlds—” For the first time, Cate hesitated. “Starfallen and I have decided . . . we believe the situation requires . . .”<br/>			“Advocate of Violence and I hereby assume the position of Supreme War Leader,” said Starfallen. “We will serve jointly and, in so doing, guarantee the continued survival and growth of our people.”<br/>			Cate jabbed a finger at Gabe, mimicking the gesture Gabe had used earlier. “The Pufferfish will now transmit full medical records of Starfallen’s condition, including neurological scans. Let all Prodryans see what Hell’s Claws would do to us. Let them see the threat their would-be Supreme War Leader allowed to grow beneath his very wings, the greatest threat our people have ever encountered.”<br/>			Starfallen clicked her mandibles and murmured, “I believe you’ve made your point.”<br/>			“End transmission!” Cate said triumphantly.<br/>			“We’re clear.” Gabe stared at his console. “We have thirty-nine incoming signals. No, forty-six. Fifty-eight. I don’t even know where to start with this, sir!”<br/>			“Ignore them,” said Monroe. By now, Supreme War Leader would be starting to awaken from his A-ring jump. Monroe didn’t envy whoever had to brief him on the situation. “Kumar, adjust our orbit. Try to keep Tuxatl between us and the Destiny.<br/>			“And what then?” asked Barryar.<br/>			Monroe unwrapped a cube of curry-flavored gum and popped it into his mouth. “Then we wait</td>

Beyond the fence, blocky-looking buildings of brick and concrete covered the sloping landscape. “It used to be a private college a couple centuries back. The Library restored two of the buildings for my team to use, but the rest is for them. We’re in there every day, passing out food and medical treatment, breaking up squabbles, working to teach and reinforce certain behaviors. Like not eating my team.”<br/>			“Sounds like the work suits you,” Monroe said stiffly. He started up the path. The stretcher followed automatically.<br/>			Wolf walked alongside him. “Did you know they have personalities?”<br/>			“What?”<br/>			“You don’t see it in the wild, but here where they’re safe, secure, and well-fed, their personalities come out more. Take Lucy. She’s a climber. We’re always finding her up a tree or wandering the top level of the old parking garage. She’s only fallen twice that I know of. Darcy, he’s an asshole. He gave me these.” She touched the scars on her chin. “Charlotte’s one of my favorites. She’s got a sense of humor.”<br/>			“A feral with a sense of humor?” Monroe repeated dubiously.<br/>			“It’s the humor of a drunk monkey, but yeah. Last month, one of our feeders, Benjamin, tripped and fell in the mud. Have you ever heard a feral laugh? I thought she was choking to death. I was about to give her a field trach when I realized what was really happening. The next day, she followed Benjamin around for more than an hour. When he was distracted, she pushed him down. Laughed even harder.”<br/>			It wasn’t behavior Monroe had ever seen from a feral human, but he didn’t have Wolf’s experience, nor had he ever seen a community of ferals in such a controlled environment. “What are you getting at?”<br/>			They stopped at a gate. A second fence stood three meters beyond the first. Wolf turned to face him. “The root word of personality is person. Ferals are still people. And Mops is still in there. We’ll take care of her, sir. I promise. I’ll start her in the old north dormitory. She’ll have the whole building to herself for the first week to give her time to adjust to being back on Earth.

It is lighter than water, yet weight for weight is as stiff, strong, and tough as steel and can resist both being stretched and compressed. It is easy to shape, as it readily splits along the grain, and is soft enough to carve, especially when green. It can be found in pieces large enough to hold up houses, yet can be cut up into tools as small as a toothpick. It can last for centuries if it is kept permanently dry or wet, yet it can also be burned to keep us warm, to cook our food, and drive a wide range of industrial processes. With all these advantages, the central role of wood in the human story was not just explicable, but inevitable.</td>

<td>You won’t be going to the Capitol,” says Gale coolly. His eyes land on a small, circular pin that adorns her dress. Real gold. Beautifully crafted. It could keep a family in bread for months. “What can you have? Five entries? I had six when I was just twelve years old.”<br/>“That’s not her fault,” I say.<br/>“No, it’s no one’s fault.

I don’t like that Gale took a dig at Madge, but he’s right, of course. The reaping system is unfair, with the poor getting the worst of it. You become eligible for the reaping the day you turn twelve. That year, your name is entered once. At thirteen, twice. And so on and so on until you reach the age of eighteen, the final year of eligibility, when your name goes into the pool seven times. That’s true for every citizen in all twelve districts in the entire country of Panem.<br/>But here’s the catch. Say you are poor and starving as we were. You can opt to add your name more times in exchange for tesserae. Each tessera is worth a meager year’s supply of grain and oil for one person. You may do this for each of your family members as well. So, at the age of twelve, I had my name entered four times. Once, because I had to, and three times for tesserae for grain and oil for myself, Prim, and my mother. In fact, every year I have needed to do this. And the entries are cumulative. So now, at the age of sixteen, my name will be in the reaping twenty times. Gale, who is eighteen and has been either helping or single-handedly feeding a family of five for seven years, will have his name in forty-two times.<br/>You can see why someone like Madge, who has never been at risk of needing a tessera, can set him off. The chance of her name being drawn is very slim compared to those of us who live in the Seam. Not impossible, but slim. And even though the rules were set up by the Capitol, not the districts, certainly not Madge’s family, it’s hard not to resent those who don’t have to sign up for tesserae.<br/>Gale knows his anger at Madge is misdirected. On other days, deep in the woods, I’ve listened to him rant about how the tesserae are just another tool to cause misery in our district. A way to plant hatred between the starving workers of the Seam and those who can generally count on supper and thereby ensure we will never trust one another. “It’s to the Capitol’s advantage to have us divided among ourselves,” he might say if there were no ears to hear but mine. If it wasn’t reaping day. If a girl with a gold pin and no tesserae had not made what I’m sure she thought was a harmless comment.<br/></td>

<td>Well, bravo!” gushes Effie Trinket. “That’s the spirit of the Games!” She’s pleased to finally have a district with a little action going on in it. “What’s your name?”<br/>I swallow hard. “Katniss Everdeen,” I say.<br/>“I bet my buttons that was your sister. Don’t want her to steal all the glory, do we? Come on, everybody! Let’s give a big round of applause to our newest tribute!” trills Effie Trinket.<br/>To the everlasting credit of the people of District 12, not one person claps. Not even the ones holding betting slips, the ones who are usually beyond caring. Possibly because they know me from the Hob, or knew my father, or have encountered Prim, who no one can help loving. So instead of acknowledging applause, I stand there unmoving while they take part in the boldest form of dissent they can manage. Silence. Which says we do not agree. We do not condone. All of this is wrong.<br/>Then something unexpected happens. At least, I don’t expect it because I don’t think of District 12 as a place that cares about me. But a shift has occurred since I stepped up to take Prim’s place, and now it seems I have become someone precious. At first one, then another, then almost every member of the crowd touches the three middle fingers of their left hand to their lips and holds it out to me. It is an old and rarely used gesture of our district, occasionally seen at funerals. It means thanks, it means admiration, it means good-bye to someone you love.</td>

His mother went back into the bakery, grumbling, but he must have been watching me as I made my way behind the pen that held their pig and leaned against the far side of an old apple tree. The realization that I’d have nothing to take home had finally sunk in. My knees buckled and I slid down the tree trunk to its roots. It was too much. I was too sick and weak and tired, oh, so tired. Let them call the Peacekeepers and take us to the community home,<br/> I thought. Or better yet, let me die right here in the rain.<br/><br/>There was a clatter in the bakery and I heard the woman screaming again and the sound of a blow, and I vaguely wondered what was going on. Feet sloshed toward me through the mud and I thought, It’s her. She’s coming to drive me away with a stick.<br/> But it wasn’t her. It was the boy. In his arms, he carried two large loaves of bread that must have fallen into the fire because the crusts were scorched black.<br/>His mother was yelling, “Feed it to the pig, you stupid creature! Why not? No one decent will buy burned bread!”<br/>He began to tear off chunks from the burned parts and toss them into the trough, and the front bakery bell rung and the mother disappeared to help a customer.<br/>The boy never even glanced my way, but I was watching him. Because of the bread, because of the red weal that stood out on his cheekbone. What had she hit him with? My parents never hit us. I couldn’t even imagine it. The boy took one look back to the bakery as if checking that the coast was clear, then, his attention back on the pig, he threw a loaf of bread in my direction. The second quickly followed, and he sloshed back to the bakery, closing the kitchen door tightly behind him.<br/>I stared at the loaves in disbelief. They were fine, perfect really, except</td>

Might have dropped the loaves into the flames, knowing it meant being punished, and then delivered them to me. But I dismissed this. It must have been an accident. Why would he have done it? He didn’t even know me. Still, just throwing me the bread was an enormous kindness that would have surely resulted in a beating if discovered. I couldn’t explain his actions.<br/>We ate slices of bread for breakfast and headed to school. It was as if spring had come overnight. Warm sweet air. Fluffy clouds. At school, I passed the boy in the hall, his cheek had swelled up and his eye had blackened. He was with his friends and didn’t acknowledge me in any way. But as I collected Prim and started for home that afternoon, I found him staring at me from across the school yard. Our eyes met for only a second, then he turned his head away. I dropped my gaze, embarrassed, and that’s when I saw it. The first dandelion of the year. A bell went off in my head. I thought of the hours spent in the woods with my father and I knew how we were going to survive.<br/>To this day, I can never shake the connection between this boy, Peeta Mellark, and the bread that gave me hope, and the dandelion that reminded me that I was not doomed. And more than once, I have turned in the school hallway and caught his eyes trained on me, only to quickly flit away. I feel like I owe him something, and I hate owing people.

<td>Prim is not to take any tesserae. They can get by, if they’re careful, on selling Prim’s goat milk and cheese and the small apothecary business my mother now runs for the people in the Seam. Gale will get her the herbs she doesn’t grow herself, but she must be very careful to describe them because he’s not as familiar with them as I am. He’ll also bring them game — he and I made a pact about this a year or so ago — and will probably not ask for compensation, but they should thank him with some kind of trade, like milk or medicine.<br/>I don’t bother suggesting Prim learn to hunt. I tried to teach her a couple of times and it was disastrous. The woods terrified her, and whenever I shot something, she’d get teary and talk about how we might be able to heal it if we got it home soon enough. But she makes out well with her goat, so I concentrate on that.<br/>When I am done with instructions about fuel, and trading, and staying in school, I turn to my mother and grip her arm, hard. “Listen to me. Are you listening to me?” She nods, alarmed by my intensity. She must know what’s coming. “You can’t leave again,” I say.<br/>My mother’s eyes find the floor. “I know. I won’t. I couldn’t help what —”<br/>“Well, you have to help it this time. You can’t clock out and leave Prim on her own. There’s no me now to keep you both alive. It doesn’t matter what happens. Whatever you see on the screen. You have to promise me you’ll fight through it!” My voice has risen to a shout. In it is all the anger, all the fear I felt at her abandonment.<br/>She pulls her arm from my grasp, moved to anger herself now. “I was ill. I could have treated myself if I’d had the medicine I have now.”<br/>That part about her being ill might be true. I’ve seen her bring back people suffering from immobilizing sadness since. Perhaps it is a sickness, but it’s one we can’t afford.<br/>“Then take it. And take care of her!” I say.<br/>“I’ll be all right, Katniss,” says Prim, clasping my face in her hands. “But you have to take care, too. You’re so fast and brave. Maybe you can win.”<br/>I can’t win. Prim must know that in her heart. The competition will be far beyond my abilities.

After all, I’ll be trying to kill his son soon. But we do know each other a bit, and he knows Prim even better. When she sells her goat cheeses at the Hob, she puts two of them aside for him and he gives her a generous amount of bread in return. We always wait to trade with him when his witch of a wife isn’t around because he’s so much nicer. I feel certain he would never have hit his son the way she did over the burned bread. But why has he come to see me?<br/>The baker sits awkwardly on the edge of one of the plush chairs. He’s a big, broad-shouldered man with burn scars from years at the ovens. He must have just said good-bye to his son.<br/>He pulls a white paper package from his jacket pocket and holds it out to me. I open it and find cookies. These are a luxury we can never afford.<br/>“Thank you,” I say. The baker’s not a very talkative man in the best of times, and today he has no words at all. “I had some of your bread this morning. My friend Gale gave you a squirrel for it.” He nods, as if remembering the squirrel. “Not your best trade,” I say. He shrugs as if it couldn’t possibly matter.<br/>Then I can’t think of anything else, so we sit in silence until a Peacemaker summons him. He rises and coughs to clear his throat. “I’ll keep an eye on the little girl. Make sure she’s eating.”<br/>I feel some of the pressure in my chest lighten at his words.

Wearing a token from my district is about the last thing on my mind.<br/>“Here, I’ll put it on your dress, all right?” Madge doesn’t wait for an answer, she just leans in and fixes the bird to my dress. “Promise you’ll wear it into the arena, Katniss?” she asks. “Promise?”<br/>“Yes,” I say. Cookies. A pin. I’m getting all kinds of gifts today. Madge gives me one more. A kiss on the cheek. Then she’s gone and I’m left thinking that maybe Madge really has been my friend all along.</td>

<td>Finally, Gale is here and maybe there is nothing romantic between us, but when he opens his arms I don’t hesitate to go into them. His body is familiar to me — the way it moves, the smell of wood smoke, even the sound of his heart beating I know from quiet moments on a hunt — but this is the first time I really feel it, lean and hard-muscled against my own.<br/>“Listen,” he says. “Getting a knife should be pretty easy, but you’ve got to get your hands on a bow. That’s your best chance.”<br/>“They don’t always have bows,” I say, thinking of the year there were only horrible spiked maces that the tributes had to bludgeon one another to death with.<br/>“Then make one,” says Gale. “Even a weak bow is better than no bow at all.”<br/>I have tried copying my father’s bows with poor results. It’s not that easy. Even he had to scrap his own work sometimes.<br/>“I don’t even know if there’ll be wood,” I say. Another year, they tossed everybody into a landscape of nothing but boulders and sand and scruffy bushes. I particularly hated that year. Many contestants were bitten by venomous snakes or went insane from thirst.<br/>“There’s almost always some wood,” Gale says. “Since that year half of them died of cold. Not much entertainment in that.”<br/>It’s true. We spent one Hunger Games watching the players freeze to death at night. You could hardly see them because they were just huddled in balls and had no wood for fires or torches or anything. It was considered very anticlimactic in the Capitol, all those quiet, bloodless deaths. Since then, there’s usually been wood to make fires.<br/>“Yes, there’s usually some,” I say.<br/>“Katniss, it’s just hunting. You’re the best hunter I know,” says Gale.<br/>“It’s not just hunting. They’re armed. They think,” I say.<br/>“So do you. And you’ve had more practice. Real practice,” he says. “You know how to kill.”<br/>“Not people,” I say.<br/>“How different can it be, really?” says Gale grimly.<br/>The awful thing is that if I can forget they’re people, it will be no different at all.</td>

But I’ve had a lot of practice at wiping my face clean of emotions and I do this now. I catch a glimpse of myself on the television screen on the wall that’s airing my arrival live and feel gratified that I appear almost bored.<br/>Peeta Mellark, on the other hand, has obviously been crying and interestingly enough does not seem to be trying to cover it up. I immediately wonder if this will be his strategy in the Games. To appear weak and frightened, to reassure the other tributes that he is no competition at all, and then come out fighting. This worked very well for a girl, Johanna Mason, from District 7 a few years back. She seemed like such a sniveling, cowardly fool that no one bothered about her until there were only a handful of contestants left. It turned out she could kill viciously. Pretty clever, the way she played it. But this seems an odd strategy for Peeta Mellark because he’s a baker’s son. All those years of having enough to eat and hauling bread trays around have made him broad-shouldered and strong. It will take an awful lot of weeping to convince anyone to overlook him.<br/>We have to stand for a few minutes</td>

<td>the last minute, I remember Madge’s little gold pin. For the first time, I get a good look at it. It’s as if someone fashioned a small golden bird and then attached a ring around it. The bird is connected to the ring only by its wing tips. I suddenly recognize it. A mockingjay.<br/>They’re funny birds and something of a slap in the face to the Capitol. During the rebellion, the Capitol bred a series of genetically altered animals as weapons. The common term for them was muttations<br/> , or sometimes mutts<br/> for short. One was a special bird called a jabberjay that had the ability to memorize and repeat whole human conversations. They were homing birds, exclusively male, that were released into regions where the Capitol’s enemies were known to be hiding. After the birds gathered words, they’d fly back to centers to be recorded. It took people awhile to realize what was going on in the districts, how private conversations were being transmitted. Then, of course, the rebels fed the Capitol endless lies, and the joke was on it. So the centers were shut down and the birds were abandoned to die off in the wild.<br/>Only they didn’t die off. Instead, the jabberjays mated with female mockingbirds, creating a whole new species that could replicate both bird whistles and human melodies. They had lost the ability to enunciate words but could still mimic a range of human vocal sounds, from a child’s high-pitched warble to a man’s deep tones. And they could re-create songs. Not just a few notes, but whole songs with multiple verses, if you had the patience to sing them and if they liked your voice.<br/>My father was particularly fond of mockingjays. When we went hunting, he would whistle or sing complicated songs to them and, after a polite pause, they’d always sing back. Not everyone is treated with such respect. But whenever my father sang, all the birds in the area would fall silent and listen. His voice was that beautiful, high and clear and so filled with life it made you want to laugh and cry at the same time. I could never bring myself to continue the practice after he was gone. Still, there’s something comforting about the little bird. It’s like having a piece of my father with me, protecting me. I fasten the pin onto my shirt, and with the dark green fabric as a background, I can almost imagine the mockingjay flying through the trees.<br/>Effie Trinket comes to collect me for supper.

<td>The supper comes in courses. A thick carrot soup, green salad, lamb chops and mashed potatoes, cheese and fruit, a chocolate cake. Throughout the meal, Effie Trinket keeps reminding us to save space because there’s more to come. But I’m stuffing myself because I’ve never had food like this, so good and so much, and because probably the best thing I can do between now and the Games is put on a few pounds.<br/>“At least, you two have decent manners,” says Effie as we’re finishing the main course. “The pair last year ate everything with their hands like a couple of savages. It completely upset my digestion.”<br/>The pair last year were two kids from the Seam who’d never, not one day of their lives, had enough to eat. And when they did have food, table manners were surely the last thing on their minds. Peeta’s a baker’s son. My mother taught Prim and me to eat properly, so yes, I can handle a fork and knife. But I hate Effie Trinket’s comment so much I make a point of eating the rest of my meal with my fingers. Then I wipe my hands on the tablecloth.

But judging by the state he’s in, Haymitch will have no memory of this tomorrow.<br/>“All right,” I say. “I can send one of the Capitol people to help you.” There’s any number on the train.

I can’t stand the sight of the Capitol people myself. But making them deal with Haymitch might be a small form of revenge. So I’m pondering the reason why he insists on taking care of Haymitch and all of a sudden I think, It’s because he’s being kind.

<td>When I get back to my room, the train is pausing at a platform to refuel. I quickly open the window, toss the cookies Peeta’s father gave me out of the train, and slam the glass shut. No more. No more of either of them.<br/>Unfortunately, the packet of cookies hits the ground and bursts open in a patch of dandelions by the track. I only see the image for a moment, because the train is off again, but it’s enough. Enough to remind me of that other dandelion in the school yard years ago . . .<br/>I had just turned away from Peeta Mellark’s bruised face when I saw the dandelion and I knew hope wasn’t lost. I plucked it carefully and hurried home. I grabbed a bucket and Prim’s hand and headed to the Meadow and yes, it was dotted with the golden-headed weeds. After we’d harvested those, we scrounged along inside the fence for probably a mile until we’d filled the bucket with the dandelion greens, stems, and flowers. That night, we gorged ourselves on dandelion salad and the rest of the bakery bread.<br/>“What else?” Prim asked me. “What other food can we find?”<br/>“All kinds of things,” I promised her. “I just have to remember them.”<br/>My mother had a book she’d brought with her from the apothecary shop. The pages were made of old parchment and covered in ink drawings of plants. Neat handwritten blocks told their names, where to gather them, when they came in bloom, their medical uses. But my father added other entries to the book. Plants for eating, not healing. Dandelions, pokeweed, wild onions, pines. Prim and I spent the rest of the night poring over those pages.<br/>The next day, we were off school. For a while I hung around the edges of the Meadow, but finally I worked up the courage to go under the fence. It was the first time I’d been there alone, without my father’s weapons to protect me. But I retrieved the small bow and arrows he’d made me from a hollow tree. I probably didn’t go more than twenty yards into the woods that day. Most of the time, I perched up in the branches of an old oak, hoping for game to come by. After several hours, I had the good luck to kill a rabbit. I’d shot a few rabbits before, with my father’s guidance. But this I’d done on my own.<br/>We hadn’t had meat in months. The sight of the rabbit seemed to stir something in my mother. She roused herself, skinned the carcass, and made a stew with the meat and some more greens Prim had gathered. Then she acted confused and went back to bed, but when the stew was done, we made her eat a bowl.<br/>The woods became our savior, and each day I went a bit farther into its arms. It was slow-going at first, but I was determined to feed us. I stole eggs from nests, caught fish in nets, sometimes managed to shoot a squirrel or rabbit for stew, and gathered the various plants that sprung up beneath my feet. Plants are tricky. Many are edible, but one false mouthful and you’re dead. I checked and double-checked the plants I harvested with my father’s pictures. I kept us alive.<br/></td>

On the eighth of every month, I was entitled to do the same. I couldn’t stop hunting and gathering, of course. The grain was not enough to live on, and there were other things to buy, soap and milk and thread. What we didn’t absolutely have to eat, I began to trade at the Hob. It was frightening to enter that place without my father at my side, but people had respected him, and they accepted me. Game was game after all, no matter who’d shot it. I also sold at the back doors of the wealthier clients in town, trying to remember what my father had told me and learning a few new tricks as well. The butcher would buy my rabbits but not squirrels. The baker enjoyed squirrel but would only trade for one if his wife wasn’t around. The Head Peacekeeper loved wild turkey.

I knelt down in the water, my fingers digging into the soft mud, and I pulled up handfuls of the roots. Small, bluish tubers that don’t look like much but boiled or baked are as good as any potato. “Katniss,” I said aloud. It’s the plant I was named for. And I heard my father’s voice joking, “As long as you can find yourself, you’ll never starve.” I spent hours stirring up the pond bed with my toes and a stick, gathering the tubers that floated to the top. That night, we feasted on fish and katniss roots until we were all, for the first time in months, full.<br/>Slowly, my mother returned to us. She began to clean and cook and preserve some of the food I brought in for winter. People traded us or paid money for her medical remedies. One day, I heard her singing.<br/>Prim was thrilled to have her back, but I kept watching, waiting for her to disappear on us again. I didn’t trust her. And some small gnarled place inside me hated her for her weakness, for her neglect, for the months she had put us through. Prim forgave her, but I had taken a step back from my mother, put up a wall to protect myself from needing her, and nothing was ever the same between us again.<br/>Now I was going to die without that ever being set right. I thought of how I had yelled at her today in the Justice Building. I had told her I loved her, too, though. So maybe it would all balance out.</td>

<td>Prim will undoubtedly sleep with my mother tonight. The thought of that scruffy old Buttercup posting himself on the bed to watch over Prim comforts me. If she cries, he will nose his way into her arms and curl up there until she calms down and falls asleep. I’m so glad I didn’t drown him</td>

It’s going to be a big, big, big day!” I try and imagine, for a moment, what it must be like inside that woman’s head. What thoughts fill her waking hours? What dreams come to her at night?

<td>One time, my mother told me that I always eat like I’ll never see food again. And I said, “I won’t unless I bring it home.” That shut her up.<br/>When my stomach feels like it’s about to split open, I lean back and take in my breakfast companions. Peeta is still eating, breaking off bits of roll and dipping them in hot chocolate. Haymitch hasn’t paid much attention to his platter, but he’s knocking back a glass of red juice that he keeps thinning with a clear liquid from a bottle. Judging by the fumes, it’s some kind of spirit. I don’t know Haymitch, but I’ve seen him often enough in the Hob, tossing handfuls of money on the counter of the woman who sells white liquor. He’ll be incoherent by the time we reach the Capitol.<br/>I realize I detest Haymitch. No wonder the District 12 tributes never stand a chance. It isn’t just that we’ve been underfed and lack training. Some of our tributes have still been strong enough to make a go of it. But we rarely get sponsors and he’s a big part of the reason why. The rich people who back tributes — either because they’re betting on them or simply for the bragging rights of picking a winner — expect someone classier than Haymitch to deal with.<br/>“So, you’re supposed to give us advice,” I say to Haymitch.<br/>“Here’s some advice. Stay alive,” says Haymitch, and then bursts out laughing. I exchange a look with Peeta before I remember I’m having nothing more to do with him. I’m surprised to see the hardness in his eyes. He generally seems so mild.<br/>“That’s very funny,” says Peeta. Suddenly he lashes out at the glass in Haymitch’s hand. It shatters on the floor, sending the bloodred liquid running toward the back of the train. “Only not to us.”<br/>Haymitch considers this a moment, then punches Peeta in the jaw, knocking him from his chair. When he turns back to reach for the spirits, I drive my knife into the table between his hand and the bottle, barely missing his fingers. I brace myself to deflect his hit, but it doesn’t come. Instead he sits back and squints at us.<br/>“Well, what’s this?” says Haymitch. “Did I actually get a pair of fighters this year?”<br/>Peeta rises from the floor and scoops up a handful of ice from under the fruit tureen. He starts to raise it to the red mark on his jaw.<br/>“No,” says Haymitch, stopping him. “Let the bruise show. The audience will think you’ve mixed it up with another tribute before you’ve even made it to the arena.”<br/>“That’s against the rules,” says Peeta.<br/>“Only if they catch you. That bruise will say you fought, you weren’t caught, even better,” says Haymitch</td>

<td>Stand over here. Both of you,” says Haymitch, nodding to the middle of the room. We obey and he circles us, prodding us like animals at times, checking our muscles, examining our faces. “Well, you’re not entirely hopeless. Seem fit. And once the stylists get hold of you, you’ll be attractive enough.”<br/>Peeta and I don’t question this. The Hunger Games aren’t a beauty contest, but the best-looking tributes always seem to pull more sponsors.<br/>“All right, I’ll make a deal with you. You don’t interfere with my drinking, and I’ll stay sober enough to help you,” says Haymitch. “But you have to do exactly what I say.”<br/>It’s not much of a deal but still a giant step forward from ten minutes ago when we had no guide at all.<br/>“Fine,” says Peeta.<br/>“So help us,” I say. “When we get to the arena, what’s the best strategy at the Cornucopia for someone —”<br/>“One thing at a time. In a few minutes, we’ll be pulling into the station. You’ll be put in the hands of your stylists. You’re not going to like what they do to you. But no matter what it is, don’t resist,” says Haymitch.<br/>“But —” I begin.<br/>“No buts. Don’t resist,” says Haymitch. He takes the bottle of spirits from the table and leaves the car. As</td>

This has included scrubbing down my body with a gritty foam that has removed not only dirt but at least three layers of skin, turning my nails into uniform shapes, and primarily, ridding my body of hair. My legs, arms, torso, underarms, and parts of my eyebrows have been stripped of the stuff, leaving me like a plucked bird, ready for roasting. I don’t like it. My skin feels sore and tingling and intensely vulnerable. But I have kept my side of the bargain with Haymitch, and no objection has crossed my lips.<br/>“You’re doing very well,” says some guy named Flavius. He gives his orange corkscrew locks a shake and applies a fresh coat of purple lipstick to his mouth. “If there’s one thing we can’t stand, it’s a whiner. Grease her down!”<br/>Venia and Octavia, a plump woman whose entire body has been dyed a pale shade of pea green, rub me down with a lotion that first stings but then soothes my raw skin. Then they pull me from the table, removing the thin robe I’ve been allowed to wear off and on. I stand there, completely naked, as the three circle me, wielding tweezers to remove any last bits of hair. I know I should be embarrassed, but they’re so unlike people that I’m no more self-conscious than if a trio of oddly colored birds were pecking around my feet.<br/>The three step back and admire their work. “Excellent! You almost look like a human being now!” says Flavius, and they all laugh.<br/>I force my lips up into a smile to show how grateful I am. “Thank you,” I say sweetly. “We don’t have much cause to look nice in District Twelve.”<br/>This wins them over completely. “Of course, you don’t, you poor darling!” says Octavia clasping her hands together in distress for me.<br/>“But don’t worry,” says Venia. “By the time Cinna is through with you, you’re going to be absolutely gorgeous!”<br/>“We promise! You know, now that we’ve gotten rid of all the hair and filth, you’re not horrible at all!” says Flavius encouragingly. “Let’s call Cinna!”<br/>They dart out of the room.

<td>Cinna invites me to sit on one of the couches and takes his place across from me. He presses a button on the side of the table. The top splits and from below rises a second tabletop that holds our lunch. Chicken and chunks of oranges cooked in a creamy sauce laid on a bed of pearly white grain, tiny green peas and onions, rolls shaped like flowers, and for dessert, a pudding the color of honey.<br/>I try to imagine assembling this meal myself back home. Chickens are too expensive, but I could make do with a wild turkey. I’d need to shoot a second turkey to trade for an orange. Goat’s milk would have to substitute for cream. We can grow peas in the garden. I’d have to get wild onions from the woods. I don’t recognize the grain, our own tessera ration cooks down to an unattractive brown mush. Fancy rolls would mean another trade with the baker, perhaps for two or three squirrels. As for the pudding, I can’t even guess what’s in it. Days of hunting and gathering for this one meal and even then it would be a poor substitution for the Capitol version.<br/>What must it be like, I wonder, to live in a world where food appears at the press of a button? How would I spend the hours I now commit to combing the woods for sustenance if it were so easy to come by? What do they do all day, these people in the Capitol, besides decorating their bodies and waiting around for a new shipment of tributes to roll in and die for their entertainment?<br/>I look up and find Cinna’s eyes trained on mine. “How despicable we must seem to you,” he says.<br/>Has he seen this in my face or somehow read my thoughts? He’s right, though. The whole rotten lot of them is despicable.<br/></td>

The people of the Capitol are going nuts, showering us with flowers, shouting our names, our first names, which they have bothered to find on the program.<br/>The pounding music, the cheers, the admiration work their way into my blood, and I can’t suppress my excitement.

<td>Apparently, Effie Trinket’s duties did not conclude at the station. She and Haymitch will be overseeing us right into the arena. In a way, that’s a plus because at least she can be counted on to corral us around to places on time whereas we haven’t seen Haymitch since he agreed to help us on the train. Probably passed out somewhere. Effie Trinket, on the other hand, seems to be flying high. We’re the first team she’s ever chaperoned that made a splash at the opening ceremonies. She’s complimentary about not just our costumes but how we conducted ourselves. And, to hear her tell it, Effie knows everyone who’s anyone in the Capitol and has been talking us up all day, trying to win us sponsors.<br/>“I’ve been very mysterious, though,” she says, her eyes squint half shut. “Because, of course, Haymitch hasn’t bothered to tell me your strategies. But I’ve done my best with what I had to work with. How Katniss sacrificed herself for her sister. How you’ve both successfully struggled to overcome the barbarism of your district.”<br/>Barbarism? That’s ironic coming from a woman helping to prepare us for slaughter. And what’s she basing our success on? Our table manners?<br/>“Everyone has their reservations, naturally. You being from the coal district. But I said, and this was very clever of me, I said, ‘Well, if you put enough pressure on coal it turns to pearls!’” Effie beams at us so brilliantly that we have no choice but to respond enthusiastically to her cleverness even though it’s wrong.<br/>Coal doesn’t turn to pearls. They grow in shellfish. Possibly she meant coal turns to diamonds, but that’s untrue, too. I’ve heard they have some sort of machine in District 1 that can turn graphite into diamonds. But we don’t mine graphite in District 12. That was part of District 13’s job until they were destroyed.<br/>I wonder if the people she’s been plugging us to all day either know or care.<br/>“Unfortunately, I can’t seal the sponsor deals for you. Only Haymitch can do that,” says Effie grimly. “But don’t worry, I’ll get him to the table at gunpoint if necessary.”<br/>Although lacking in many departments, Effie Trinket has a certain determination I have to admire.</td>

<td>I try to focus on the talk, which has turned to our interview costumes, when a girl sets a gorgeous-looking cake on the table and deftly lights it. It blazes up and then the flames flicker around the edges awhile until it finally goes out. I have a moment of doubt. “What makes it burn? Is it alcohol?” I say, looking up at the girl. “That’s the last thing I wa — oh! I know you!”<br/>I can’t place a name or time to the girl’s face. But I’m certain of it. The dark red hair, the striking features, the porcelain white skin. But even as I utter the words, I feel my insides contracting with anxiety and guilt at the sight of her, and while I can’t pull it up, I know some bad memory is associated with her. The expression of terror that crosses her face only adds to my confusion and unease. She shakes her head in denial quickly and hurries away from the table.<br/>When I look back, the four adults are watching me like hawks.<br/>“Don’t be ridiculous, Katniss. How could you possibly know an Avox?” snaps Effie. “The very thought.”<br/>“What’s an Avox?” I ask stupidly.<br/>“Someone who committed a crime. They cut her tongue so she can’t speak,” says Haymitch. “She’s probably a traitor of some sort. Not likely you’d know her.”<br/>“And even if you did, you’re not to speak to one of them unless it’s to give an order,” says Effie. “Of course, you don’t really know her.”<br/>But I do know her. And now that Haymitch has mentioned the word traitor<br/> I remember from where. The disapproval is so high I could never admit it. “No, I guess not, I just —” I stammer, and the wine is not helping.<br/>Peeta snaps his fingers. “Delly Cartwright. That’s who it is. I kept thinking she looked familiar as well. Then I realized she’s a dead ringer for Delly.”<br/>Delly Cartwright is a pasty-faced, lumpy girl with yellowish hair who looks about as much like our server as a beetle does a butterfly. She may also be the friendliest person on the planet — she smiles constantly at everybody in school, even me. I have never seen the girl with the red hair smile. But I jump on Peeta’s suggestion gratefully. “Of course, that’s who I was thinking of. It must be the hair,” I say.<br/>“Something about the eyes, too,” says Peeta.<br/>The energy at the table relaxes. “Oh, well. If that’s all it is,” says Cinna. “And yes, the cake has spirits, but all the alcohol has burned off. I ordered it specially in honor of your fiery debut.”<br/>We eat the cake and move into a sitting room to watch the replay of the opening ceremonies that’s being broadcast. A few of the other couples make a nice impression, but none of them can hold a candle to us. Even our own party lets out an “Ahh!” as they show us coming out of the Remake Center.<br/>“Whose idea was the hand holding?” asks Haymitch.<br/>“Cinna’s,” says Portia.<br/>“Just the perfect touch of rebellion,” says Haymitch. “Very nice.”<br/>Rebellion? I have to think about that one a moment. But when I remember the other couples, standing stiffly apart, never touching or acknowledging each other, as if their fellow tribute did not exist, as if the Games had already begun, I know what Haymitch means. Presenting ourselves not as adversaries but as friends has distinguished us as much as the fiery costumes.<br/>“Tomorrow morning is the first training session. Meet me for breakfast and I’ll tell you exactly how I want you to play it,” says Haymitch to Peeta and</td>

<td>Peeta and I walk together down the corridor to our rooms. When we get to my door, he leans against the frame, not blocking my entrance exactly but insisting I pay attention to him. “So, Delly Cartwright. Imagine finding her lookalike here.”<br/>He’s asking for an explanation, and I’m tempted to give him one. We both know he covered for me. So here I am in his debt again. If I tell him the truth about the girl, somehow that might even things up. How can it hurt really? Even if he repeated the story, it couldn’t do me much harm. It was just something I witnessed. And he lied as much as I did about Delly Cartwright.<br/>I realize I do want to talk to someone about the girl. Someone who might be able to help me figure out her story. Gale would be my first choice, but it’s unlikely I’ll ever see Gale again. I try to think if telling Peeta could give him any possible advantage over me, but I don’t see how. Maybe sharing a confidence will actually make him believe I see him as a friend.<br/>Besides, the idea of the girl with her maimed tongue frightens me. She has reminded me why I’m here. Not to model flashy costumes and eat delicacies. But to die a bloody death while the crowds urge on my killer.<br/>To tell or not to tell? My brain still feels slow from the wine. I stare down the empty corridor as if the decision lies there.<br/>Peeta picks up on my hesitation. “Have you been on the roof yet?” I shake my head. “Cinna showed me. You can practically see the whole city. The wind’s a bit loud, though.”<br/>I translate this into “No one will overhear us talking” in my head. You do have the sense that we might be under surveillance here. “</td>

<td>Maybe,” he admits. “Come see the garden.”<br/>On the other side of the dome, they’ve built a garden with flower beds and potted trees. From the branches hang hundreds of wind chimes, which account for the tinkling I heard. Here in the garden, on this windy night, it’s enough to drown out two people who are trying not to be heard. Peeta looks at me expectantly.<br/>I pretend to examine a blossom. “We were hunting in the woods one day. Hidden, waiting for game,” I whisper.<br/>“You and your father?” he whispers back.<br/>“No, my friend Gale. Suddenly all the birds stopped singing at once. Except one. As if it were giving a warning call. And then we saw her. I’m sure it was the same girl. A boy was with her. Their clothes were tattered. They had dark circles under their eyes from no sleep. They were running as if their lives depended on it,” I say.<br/>For a moment I’m silent, as I remember how the sight of this strange pair, clearly not from District 12, fleeing through the woods immobilized us. Later, we wondered if we could have helped them escape. Perhaps we might have. Concealed them. If we’d moved quickly. Gale and I were taken by surprise, yes, but we’re both hunters. We know how animals look at bay. We knew the pair was in trouble as soon as we saw them. But we only watched.<br/>“The hovercraft appeared out of nowhere,” I continue to Peeta. “I mean, one moment the sky was empty and the next it was there. It didn’t make a sound, but they saw it. A net dropped down on the girl and carried her up, fast, so fast like the elevator. They shot some sort of spear through the boy. It was attached to a cable and they hauled him up as well. But I’m certain he was dead. We heard the girl scream once. The boy’s name, I think. Then it was gone, the hovercraft. Vanished into thin air. And the birds began to sing again, as if nothing had happened.”<br/>“Did they see you?” Peeta asked.<br/>“I don’t know. We were under a shelf of rock,” I reply. But I do know. There was a moment, after the birdcall, but before the hovercraft, where the girl had seen us. She’d locked eyes with me and called out for help. But neither Gale or I had responded.<br/>“You’re shivering,” says Peeta.<br/>The wind and the story have blown all the warmth from my body. The girl’s scream. Had it been her last?<br/>Peeta takes off his jacket and wraps it around my shoulders. I start to take a step back, but then I let him, deciding for a moment to accept both his jacket and his kindness. A friend would do that, right?<br/></td>

But you have to admit, the food’s prime.”<br/>He’s covered again. If that’s all you’d heard it would just sound like the words of a scared tribute, not someone contemplating the unquestionable goodness of the Capitol.</td>

I think he wishes he had a daughter instead of a houseful of boys.”<br/>The idea that I might ever have been discussed, around the dinner table, at the bakery fire, just in passing in Peeta’s house gives me a start. It must have been when the mother was out of the room.<br/>“He knew your mother when they were kids,” says Peeta.<br/>Another surprise. But probably true. “Oh, yes. She grew up in town,” I say. It seems impolite to say she never mentioned the baker except to compliment his bread.</td>

<td>When I open my door, the redheaded girl is collecting my unitard and boots from where I left them on the floor before my shower. I want to apologize for possibly getting her in trouble earlier. But I remember I’m not supposed to speak to her unless I’m giving her an order.<br/>“Oh, sorry,” I say. “I was supposed to get those back to Cinna. I’m sorry. Can you take them to him?”<br/>She avoids my eyes, gives a small nod, and heads out the door.<br/>I’d set out to tell her I was sorry about dinner. But I know that my apology runs much deeper. That I’m ashamed I never tried to help her in the woods. That I let the Capitol kill the boy and mutilate her without lifting a finger.<br/>Just like I was watching the Games.<br/>I kick off my shoes and climb under the covers in my clothes. The shivering hasn’t stopped. Perhaps the girl doesn’t even remember me. But I know she does. You don’t forget the face of the person who was your last hope. I pull the covers up over my head as if this will protect me from the redheaded girl who can’t speak. But I can feel her eyes staring at me, piercing through walls and doors and bedding.<br/>I wonder if she’ll enjoy watching me die.</td>

<td>Haymitch and Peeta come in, bid me good morning, fill their plates. It makes me irritated that Peeta is wearing exactly the same outfit I am. I need to say something to Cinna. This twins act is going to blow up in our faces once the Games begin. Surely, they must know this. Then I remember Haymitch telling me to do exactly what the stylists tell me to do. If it was anyone but Cinna, I might be tempted to ignore him. But after last night’s triumph, I don’t have a lot of room to criticize his choices</td>

<td>When Haymitch has finished several platters of stew, he pushes back his plate with a sigh. He takes a flask from his pocket and takes a long pull on it and leans his elbows on the table. “So, let’s get down to business. Training. First off, if you like, I’ll coach you separately. Decide now.”<br/>“Why would you coach us separately?” I ask.<br/>“Say if you had a secret skill you might not want the other to know about,” says Haymitch.<br/>I exchange a look with Peeta. “I don’t have any secret skills,” he says. “And I already know what yours is, right? I mean, I’ve eaten enough of your squirrels.”<br/>I never thought about Peeta eating the squirrels I shot. Somehow I always pictured the baker quietly going off and frying them up for himself. Not out of greed. But because town families usually eat expensive butcher meat. Beef and chicken and horse.<br/></td>

<td>“I can’t do anything,” says Peeta. “Unless you count baking bread.”<br/>“Sorry, I don’t. Katniss. I already know you’re handy with a knife,” says Haymitch.<br/>“Not really. But I can hunt,” I say. “With a bow and arrow.”<br/>“And you’re good?” asks Haymitch.<br/>I have to think about it. I’ve been putting food on the table for four years. That’s no small task. I’m not as good as my father was, but he’d had more practice. I’ve better aim than Gale, but I’ve had more practice. He’s a genius with traps and snares. “I’m all right,” I say.<br/>“She’s excellent,” says Peeta. “My father buys her squirrels. He always comments on how the arrows never pierce the body. She hits every one in the eye. It’s the same with the rabbits she sells the butcher. She can even bring down deer.”<br/>This assessment of my skills from Peeta takes me totally by surprise. First, that he ever noticed. Second, that he’s talking me up. “What are you doing?” I ask him suspiciously.<br/>“What are you doing? If he’s going to help you, he has to know what you’re capable of. Don’t underrate yourself,” says Peeta.<br/>I don’t know why, but this rubs me the wrong way. “What about you? I’ve seen you in the market. You can lift hundred-pound bags of flour,” I snap at him. “Tell him that. That’s not nothing.”<br/>“Yes, and I’m sure the arena will be full of bags of flour for me to chuck at people. It’s not like being able to use a weapon. You know it isn’t,” he shoots back.<br/>“He can wrestle,” I tell Haymitch. “He came in second in our school competition last year, only after his brother.”<br/>“What use is that? How many times have you seen someone wrestle someone to death?” says Peeta in disgust.<br/>“There’s always hand-to-hand combat. All you need is to come up with a knife, and you’ll at least stand a chance. If I get jumped, I’m dead!” I can hear my voice rising in anger.<br/>“But you won’t! You’ll be living up in some tree eating raw squirrels and picking off people with arrows. You know what my mother said to me when she came to say good-bye, as if to cheer me up, she says maybe District Twelve will finally have a winner. Then I realized, she didn’t mean me, she meant you!” bursts out Peeta.<br/>“Oh, she meant you,” I say with a wave of dismissal.<br/>“She said, ‘She’s a survivor, that one.’ She<br/> is,” says Peeta.<br/>That pulls me up short. Did his mother really say that about me? Did she rate me over her son? I see the pain in Peeta’s eyes and know he isn’t lying.<br/>Suddenly I’m behind the bakery and I can feel the chill of the rain running down my back, the hollowness in my belly. I sound eleven years old when I speak. “But only because someone helped me.”<br/>Peeta’s eyes flicker down to the roll in my hands, and I know he remembers that day, too. But he just shrugs. “People will help you in the arena. They’ll be tripping over each other to sponsor you.”<br/>“No more than you,” I say.<br/>Peeta rolls his eyes at Haymitch. “She has no idea. The effect she can have.” He runs his fingernail along the wood grain in the table, refusing to look at me.</td>

<td>What on earth does he mean? People help me? When we were dying of starvation, no one helped me! No one except Peeta. Once I had something to barter with, things changed. I’m a tough trader. Or am I? What effect do I have? That I’m weak and needy? Is he suggesting that I got good deals because people pitied me? I try to think if this is true. Perhaps some of the merchants were a little generous in their trades, but I always attributed that to their long-standing relationship with my father. Besides, my game is first-class. No one pitied me!<br/>I glower at the roll, sure he meant to insult me.<br/>After about a minute of this, Haymitch says, “Well, then. Well, well, well. Katniss, there’s no guarantee there’ll be bows and arrows in the arena, but during your private session with the Gamemakers, show them what you can do. Until then, stay clear of archery. Are you any good at trapping?”<br/>“I know a few basic snares,” I mutter.<br/>“That may be significant in terms of food,” says Haymitch. “And, Peeta, she’s right, never underestimate strength in the arena. Very often, physical power tilts the advantage to a player. In the Training Center, they will have weights, but don’t reveal how much you can lift in front of the other tributes. The plan’s the same for both of you. You go to group training. Spend the time trying to learn something you don’t know. Throw a spear. Swing a mace. Learn to tie a decent knot. Save showing what you’re best at until your private sessions. Are we clear?” says Haymitch.<br/>Peeta and I nod.<br/>“One last thing. In public, I want you by each other’s side every minute,” says Haymitch. We both start to object, but Haymitch slams his hand on the table. “Every minute! It’s not open for discussion! You agreed to do as I said! You will be together, you will appear amiable to each other. Now get out. Meet Effie at the elevator at ten for training.”<br/>I bite my lip and stalk back to my room, making</td>

The effect she can have.<br/> Obviously meant to demean me. Right? But a tiny part of me wonders if this was a compliment. That he meant I was appealing in some way. It’s weird, how much he’s noticed me. Like the attention he’s paid to my hunting. And apparently, I have not been as oblivious to him as I imagined, either. The flour. The wrestling. I have kept track of the boy with the bread.<br/></td>

<td>When Atala begins to read down the list of the skill stations, my eyes can’t help flitting around to the other tributes. It’s the first time we’ve been assembled, on level ground, in simple clothes. My heart sinks. Almost all of the boys and at least half of the girls are bigger than I am, even though many of the tributes have never been fed properly. You can see it in their bones, their skin, the hollow look in their eyes. I may be smaller naturally, but overall my family’s resourcefulness has given me an edge in that area. I stand straight, and while I’m thin, I’m strong. The meat and plants from the woods combined with the exertion it took to get them have given me a healthier body than most of those I see around me.<br/>The exceptions are the kids from the wealthier districts, the volunteers, the ones who have been fed and trained throughout their lives for this moment. The tributes from 1, 2, and 4 traditionally have this look about them. It’s technically against the rules to train tributes before they reach the Capitol but it happens every year. In District 12, we call them the Career Tributes, or just the Careers. And like as not, the winner will be one of them.<br/>The slight advantage I held coming into the Training Center, my fiery entrance last night, seems to vanish in the presence of my competition. The other tributes were jealous of us, but not because we were amazing, because our stylists were. Now I see nothing but contempt in the glances of the Career Tributes. Each must have fifty to a hundred pounds on me. They project arrogance and brutality. When Atala releases us, they head straight for the deadliest-looking weapons in the gym and handle them with ease.</td>

<td>Suppose we tie some knots,” I say.<br/>“Right you are,” says Peeta. We cross to an empty station where the trainer seems pleased to have students. You get the feeling that the knot-tying class is not the Hunger Games hot spot. When he realizes I know something about snares, he shows us a simple, excellent trap that will leave a human competitor dangling by a leg from a tree. We concentrate on this one skill for an hour until both of us have mastered it. Then we move on to camouflage. Peeta genuinely seems to enjoy this station, swirling a combination of mud and clay and berry juices around on his pale skin, weaving disguises from vines and leaves. The trainer who runs the camouflage station is full of enthusiasm at his work.<br/>“I do the cakes,” he admits to me.<br/>“The cakes?” I ask. I’ve been preoccupied with watching the boy from District 2 send a spear through a dummy’s heart from fifteen yards. “What cakes?”<br/>“At home. The iced ones, for the bakery,” he says.<br/>He means the ones they display in the windows. Fancy cakes with flowers and pretty things painted in frosting. They’re for birthdays and New Year’s Day. When we’re in the square, Prim always drags me over to admire them, although we’d never be able to afford one. There’s little enough beauty in District 12, though, so I can hardly deny her this.<br/>I look more critically at the design on Peeta’s arm. The alternating pattern of light and dark suggests sunlight falling through the leaves in the woods. I wonder how he knows this, since I doubt he’s ever been beyond the fence. Has he been able to pick this up from just that scraggly old apple tree in his backyard? Somehow the whole thing — his skill, those inaccessible cakes, the praise of the camouflage expert — annoys me.<br/>“It’s lovely. If only you could frost someone to death,” I say.<br/>“Don’t be so superior. You can never tell what you’ll find in the arena. Say</td>

<td>It’s not easy to find a topic. Talking of home is painful. Talking of the present unbearable. One day, Peeta empties our breadbasket and points out how they have been careful to include types from the districts along with the refined bread of the Capitol. The fish-shaped loaf tinted green with seaweed from District 4. The crescent moon roll dotted with seeds from District 11. Somehow, although it’s made from the same stuff, it looks a lot more appetizing than the ugly drop biscuits that are the standard fare at home.<br/>“And there you have it,” says Peeta, scooping the breads back in the basket.<br/>“You certainly know a lot,” I say.<br/>“Only about bread,” he says. “Okay, now laugh as if I’ve said something funny.”<br/>We both give a somewhat convincing laugh and ignore the stares from around the room.<br/>“All right, I’ll keep smiling pleasantly and you talk,” says Peeta. It’s wearing us both out, Haymitch’s direction to be friendly. Because ever since I slammed my door, there’s been a chill in the air between us. But we have our orders.<br/>“Did I ever tell you about the time I was chased by a bear?” I ask.<br/>“No, but it sounds fascinating,” says Peeta.<br/>I try and animate my face as I recall the event, a true story, in which I’d foolishly challenged a black bear over the rights to a beehive. Peeta laughs and asks questions right on cue. He’s much better at this than I am.<br/></td>

She’s the twelve-year-old, the one who reminded me so of Prim in stature. Up close she looks about ten. She has bright, dark eyes and satiny brown skin and stands tilted up on her toes with her arms slightly extended to her sides, as if ready to take wing at the slightest sound. It’s impossible not to think of a bird.<br/>I pick up another spear while Peeta throws. “I think her name’s Rue,” he says softly.<br/>I bite my lip.

<td>After about fifteen minutes, they call my name. I smooth my hair, set my shoulders back, and walk into the gymnasium. Instantly, I know I’m in trouble. They’ve been here too long, the Gamemakers. Sat through twenty-three other demonstrations. Had too much wine, most of them. Want more than anything to go home.<br/>There’s nothing I can do but continue with the plan. I walk to the archery station. Oh, the weapons! I’ve been itching to get my hands on them for days! Bows made of wood and plastic and metal and materials I can’t even name. Arrows with feathers cut in flawless uniform lines. I choose a bow, string it, and sling the matching quiver of arrows over my shoulder. There’s a shooting range, but it’s much too limited. Standard bull’s-eyes and human silhouettes. I walk to the center of the gymnasium and pick my first target. The dummy used for knife practice. Even as I pull back on the bow I know something is wrong. The string’s tighter than the one I use at home. The arrow’s more rigid. I miss the dummy by a couple of inches and lose what little attention I had been commanding. For a moment, I’m humiliated, then I head back to the bull’s-eye. I shoot again and again until I get the feel of these new weapons.<br/>Back in the center of the gymnasium, I take my initial position and skewer the dummy right through the heart. Then I sever the rope that holds the sandbag for boxing, and the bag splits open as it slams to the ground. Without pausing, I shoulder-roll forward, come up on one knee, and send an arrow into one of the hanging lights high above the gymnasium floor. A shower of sparks bursts from the fixture.<br/>It’s excellent shooting. I turn to the Gamemakers. A few are nodding approval, but the majority of them are fixated on a roast pig that has just arrived at their banquet table.<br/>Suddenly I am furious, that with my life on the line, they don’t even have the decency to pay attention to me. That I’m being upstaged by a dead pig. My heart starts to pound, I can feel my face burning. Without thinking, I pull an arrow from my quiver and send it straight at the Gamemakers’ table. I hear shouts of alarm as people stumble back. The arrow skewers the apple in the pig’s mouth and pins it to the wall behind it. Everyone stares at me in disbelief.<br/>“Thank you for your consideration,” I say. Then I give a slight bow and walk straight toward the exit without being dismissed.</td>

It’s a little scary because his appearance has been virtually unchanged during all that time. Same face under a coating of pure white makeup. Same hairstyle that he dyes a different color for each Hunger Games. Same ceremonial suit, midnight blue dotted with a thousand tiny electric bulbs that twinkle like stars. They do surgery in the Capitol, to make people appear younger and thinner. In District 12, looking old is something of an achievement since so many people die early. You see an elderly person, you want to congratulate them on their longevity, ask the secret of survival. A plump person is envied because they aren’t scraping by like the majority of us. But here it is different. Wrinkles aren’t desirable. A round belly isn’t a sign of success.</td>

It’s true. My best hope is to not disgrace myself and . . .” He hesitates.<br/>“And what?” I say.<br/>“I don’t know how to say it exactly. Only . . . I want to die as myself. Does that make any sense?” he asks. I shake my head. How could he die as anyone but himself? “I don’t want them to change me in there. Turn me into some kind of monster that I’m not.”<br/>I bite my lip, feeling inferior. While I’ve been ruminating on the availability of trees, Peeta has been struggling with how to maintain his identity. His purity of self. “Do you mean you won’t kill anyone?” I ask.<br/>“No, when the time comes, I’m sure I’ll kill just like everybody else. I can’t go down without a fight. Only I keep wishing I could think of a way to . . . to show the Capitol they don’t own me. That I’m more than just a piece in their Games,” says Peeta.<br/>“But you’re not,” I say. “None of us are. That’s how the Games work.”<br/>“Okay, but within that framework, there’s still you, there’s still me,” he insists. “Don’t you see?”<br/>“A little. Only . . . no offense, but who cares, Peeta?” I say.<br/>“I do. I mean, what else am I allowed to care about at this point?” he asks angrily. He’s locked those blue eyes on mine now, demanding an answer.<br/>I take a step back. “Care about what Haymitch said. About staying alive.”<br/>Peeta smiles at me, sad and mocking. “Okay. Thanks for the tip, sweetheart.”<br/>It’s like a slap in the face. His use of Haymitch’s patronizing endearment. “Look, if you want to spend the last hours of your life planning some noble death in the arena, that’s your choice. I want to spend mine in District Twelve.”<br/>“Wouldn’t surprise me if you do,” says Peeta. “Give my mother my best when you make it back, will you?”<br/>“Count on it,” I say. Then I turn and leave the roof.</td>

That way they’ll guarantee drawing us in to fight. The lake is a full day’s journey from where I sit now, a much harder journey with nothing to drink. And then, even if I reach it, it’s sure to be heavily guarded by some of the Career Tributes. I’m about to panic when I remember the rabbit I startled earlier today. It has to drink, too.

<td> Through the branches I can see the seal of the Capitol, which appears to be floating in the sky. I’m actually viewing another screen, an enormous one that’s transported by one of their disappearing hovercraft. The anthem fades out and the sky goes dark for a moment. At home, we would be watching full coverage of each and every killing, but that’s thought to give an unfair advantage to the living tributes. For instance, if I got my hands on the bow and shot someone, my secret would be revealed to all. No, here in the arena, all we see are the same photographs they showed when they televised our training scores. Simple head shots. But now instead of scores they post only district numbers. I take a deep breath as the faces of the eleven dead tributes begin and tick them off one by one on my fingers.<br/>The first to appear is the girl from District 3. That means that the Career Tributes from 1 and 2 have all survived. No surprise there. Then the boy from 4. I didn’t expect that one, usually all the Careers make it through the first day. The boy from District 5 . . . I guess the fox-faced girl made it. Both tributes from 6 and 7. The boy from 8. Both from 9. Yes, there’s the boy who I fought for the backpack. I’ve run through my fingers, only one more dead tribute to go. Is it Peeta? No, there’s the girl from District 10. That’s it. The Capitol seal is back with a final musical flourish. Then darkness and the sounds of the forest resume.<br/>I’m relieved Peeta’s alive. I tell myself again that if I get killed, his winning will benefit my mother and Prim the most. This is what I tell myself to explain the conflicting emotions that arise when I think of Peeta. The gratitude that he gave me an edge by professing his love for me in the interview. The anger at his superiority on the roof. The dread that we may come face-to-face at any moment in this arena.<br/>Eleven dead, but none from District 12. I try</td>

While I’ve been concealed by darkness and the sleeping bag and the willow branches, it has probably been difficult for the cameras to get a good shot of me. I know they must be tracking me now though. The minute I hit the ground, I’m guaranteed a close-up.<br/>The audience will have been beside themselves, knowing I was in the tree, that I overheard the Careers talking, that I discovered Peeta was with them. Until I work out exactly how I want to play that, I’d better at least act on top of things. Not perplexed. Certainly not confused or frightened.<br/>No, I need to look one step ahead of the game.<br/>So as I slide out of the foliage and into the dawn light, I pause a second, giving the cameras time to lock on me. Then I cock my head slightly to the side and give a knowing smile. There! Let them figure out what that means!<br/>I’m about to take off when I think of my snares. Maybe it’s imprudent to check them with the others so close. But I have to. Too many years of hunting, I guess. And the lure of possible meat. I’m rewarded with one fine rabbit. In no time, I’ve cleaned and gutted the animal, leaving the head, feet, tail, skin, and innards, under a pile of leaves. I’m wishing for a fire — eating raw rabbit can give you rabbit fever, a lesson I learned the hard way — when I think of the dead tribute. I hurry back to her camp. Sure enough, the coals of her dying fire are still hot. I cut up the rabbit, fashion a spit out of branches, and set it over the coals.<br/></td>

No deaths, perhaps no fights at all. The audience in the Capitol will be getting bored, claiming that these Games are verging on dullness. This is the one thing the Games must not do.<br/>It’s not hard to follow the Gamemakers’ motivation.

Even so, look at their weapons. Look at their faces, grinning and snarling at me, a sure kill above them. It seems pretty hopeless. But then something else registers. They’re bigger and stronger than I am, no doubt, but they’re also heavier. There’s a reason it’s me and not Gale who ventures up to pluck the highest fruit, or rob the most remote bird nests.

<td>Even if I can last the night, what will the morning bring? I stare into the foliage trying to will myself to rest, but the burns forbid it. Birds are settling down for the night, singing lullabies to their young. Night creatures emerge. An owl hoots. The faint scent of a skunk cuts through the smoke. The eyes of some animal peer at me from the neighboring tree — a possum maybe — catching the firelight from the Careers’ torches. Suddenly, I’m up on one elbow. Those are no possum’s eyes, I know their glassy reflection too well. In fact, those are not animal eyes at all. In the last dim rays of light, I make her out, watching me silently from between the branches.<br/>Rue.<br/>How long has she been here? The whole time probably. Still and unobserved as the action unfolded beneath her. Perhaps she headed up her tree shortly before I did, hearing the pack was so close.<br/>For a while we hold each other’s gaze. Then, without even rustling a leaf, her little hand slides into the open and points to something above my head.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>My eyes follow the line of her finger up into the foliage above me. At first, I have no idea what she’s pointing to, but then, about fifteen feet up, I make out the vague shape in the dimming light. But of . . . of what? Some sort of animal? It looks about the size of a raccoon, but it hangs from the bottom of a branch, swaying ever so slightly. There’s something else. Among the familiar evening sounds of the woods, my ears register a low hum. Then I know. It’s a wasp nest.<br/>Fear shoots through me, but I have enough sense to keep still. After all, I don’t know what kind of wasp lives there. It could be the ordinary leave-us-alone-and-we’ll-leave-you-alone type. But these are the Hunger Games, and ordinary isn’t the norm. More likely they will be one of the Capitol’s muttations, tracker jackers. Like the jabberjays, these killer wasps were spawned in a lab and strategically placed, like land mines, around the districts</td>

<td>Now what? I could probably finish off the job by sense of feel but that may not be the smartest plan. If the wasps are too groggy, if the nest catches on its way down, if I try to escape, this could all be a deadly waste of time. Better, I think, to sneak up here at dawn and send the nest into my enemies.<br/>In the faint light of the Careers’ torches, I inch back down to my fork to find the best surprise I’ve ever had. Sitting on my sleeping bag is a small plastic pot attached to a silver parachute. My first gift from a sponsor! Haymitch must have had it sent in during the anthem. The pot easily fits in the palm of my hand. What can it be? Not food surely. I unscrew the lid and I know by the scent that it’s medicine. Cautiously, I probe the surface of the ointment. The throbbing in my fingertip vanishes.<br/>“Oh, Haymitch,” I whisper. “Thank you.” He has not abandoned me. Not left me to fend entirely for myself. The cost of this medicine must be astronomical. Probably not one but many sponsors have contributed to buy this one tiny pot. To me, it is priceless.<br/>I dip two fingers in the jar and gently spread the balm over my calf. The effect is almost magical, erasing the pain on contact, leaving a pleasant cooling sensation behind. This is no herbal concoction that my mother grinds up out of woodland plants, it’s high-tech medicine brewed up in the Capitol’s labs. When my calf is treated, I rub a thin layer into my hands. After wrapping the pot in the parachute, I nestle it safely away in my pack. Now that the pain has eased, it’s all I can do to reposition myself in my bag before I plunge into sleep.<br/>A bird perched just a few feet from me alerts me that a new day is dawning. In the gray morning light, I examine my hands. The medicine has transformed all the angry red patches to a soft baby-skin pink. My leg still feels inflamed, but that burn was far deeper. I apply another coat of medicine</td>

They bear no trace of the noxious green slime that came from Glimmer’s body — which leads me to believe that might not have been wholly real — but they have a fair amount of dried blood on them. I can clean them later, but I do take a minute to shoot a few into a nearby tree. They are more like the weapons in the Training Center than my ones at home, but who cares? That I can work with.<br/>The weapons give me an entirely new perspective on the Games. I know I have tough opponents left to face. But I am no longer merely prey that runs and hides or takes desperate measures. If Cato broke through the trees right now, I wouldn’t flee, I’d shoot.

Within a few minutes, I spot a rabbit and make my first kill with the bow and arrow. It’s not my usual clean shot through the eye, but I’ll take it. After about an hour, I find a stream, shallow but wide, and more than sufficient for my needs. The sun’s hot and severe, so while I wait for my water to purify I strip down to my underclothes and wade into the mild current. I’m filthy from head to toe. I try splashing myself but eventually just lie down in the water for a few minutes, letting it wash off the soot and blood and skin that has started to peel off my burns. After rinsing out my clothes and hanging them on bushes to dry, I sit on the bank in the sun for a bit, untangling my hair with my fingers.

You saved me with those tracker jackers. You’re smart enough to still be alive. And I can’t seem to shake you anyway,” I say. She blinks at me, trying to decide. “You hungry?” I can see her swallow hard, her eye flickering to the meat. “Come on then, I’ve had two kills today.”<br/>Rue tentatively steps out into the open. “I can fix your stings.”<br/>“Can you?” I ask. “How?”<br/>She digs in the pack she carries and pulls out a handful of leaves. I’m almost certain they’re the ones my mother uses. “Where’d you find those?”<br/>“Just around. We all carry them when we work in the orchards. They left a lot of nests there,” says Rue. “There are a lot here, too.”<br/>“That’s right. You’re District Eleven. Agriculture,” I say. “Orchards, huh? That must be how you can fly around the trees like you’ve got wings.” Rue smiles. I’ve landed on one of the few things she’ll admit pride in. “Well, come on, then. Fix me up.”<br/>I plunk down by the fire and roll up my pant leg to reveal the sting on my knee. To my surprise, Rue places the handful of leaves into her mouth and begins to chew them. My mother would use other methods, but it’s not like we have a lot of options. After a minute or so, Rue presses a gloppy green wad of chewed leaves and spit on my knee.<br/>“Ohhh.” The sound comes out of my mouth before I can stop it. It’s as if the leaves are actually leaching the pain right out of the sting.<br/>Rue gives a giggle. “Lucky you had the sense to pull the stingers out or you’d be a lot worse.”<br/>“Do my neck! Do my cheek!” I almost beg.<br/>Rue stuffs another handful of leaves in her mouth, and soon I’m laughing because the relief is so sweet. I notice a long burn on Rue’s forearm. “I’ve got something for that.” I set aside my weapons and anoint her arm with the burn medicine.<br/>“You have good sponsors,” she says longingly.<br/>“Have you gotten anything yet?” I ask. She shakes her head. “You will, though. Watch. The closer we get to the end, the more people will realize how clever you are.” I turn the meat over.<br/>“You weren’t joking, about wanting me for an ally?” she asks.<br/>“No, I meant it,” I say. I can almost hear Haymitch groaning as I team up with this wispy child. But I want her. Because she’s a survivor, and I trust her, and why not admit it?

<td>At Rue’s suggestion, we lay out all our food to plan ahead. She’s seen most of mine, but I add the last couple of crackers and beef strips to the pile. She’s gathered quite a collection of roots, nuts, greens, and even some berries.<br/>I roll an unfamiliar berry in my fingers. “You sure this is safe?”<br/>“Oh, yes, we have them back home. I’ve been eating them for days,” she says, popping a handful in her mouth. I tentatively bite into one, and it’s as good as our blackberries. Taking Rue on as an ally seems a better choice all the time. We divide up our food supplies, so in case we’re separated, we’ll both be set for a few days. Apart from the food, Rue has a small water skin, a homemade slingshot, and an extra pair of socks. She also has a sharp shard of rock she uses as a knife. “I know it’s not much,” she says as if embarrassed, “but I had to get away from the Cornucopia fast.”<br/>“You did just right,” I say. When I spread out my gear, she gasps a little when she sees the sunglasses.<br/>“How did you get those?” she asks.<br/>“In my pack. They’ve been useless so far. They don’t block the sun and they make it harder to see,” I say with a shrug.<br/>“These aren’t for sun, they’re for darkness,” exclaims Rue. “Sometimes, when we harvest through the night, they’ll pass out a few pairs to those of us highest in the trees. Where the torchlight doesn’t reach. One time, this boy Martin, he tried to keep his pair. Hid it in his pants. They killed him on the spot.”<br/>“They killed a boy for taking these?” I say.<br/>“Yes, and everyone knew he was no danger. Martin wasn’t right in the head. I mean, he still acted like a three-year-old. He just wanted the glasses to play with,” says Rue.<br/>Hearing this makes me feel like District 12 is some sort of safe haven. Of course, people keel over from starvation all the time, but I can’t imagine the Peacekeepers murdering a simpleminded child. There’s a little girl, one of Greasy Sae’s grandkids, who wanders around the Hob. She’s not quite right, but she’s treated as a sort of pet. People toss her scraps and things.<br/></td>

<td>Besides, I’m distracted by my latest idea about the Careers and their supplies. Somehow Rue and I must find a way to destroy their food. I’m pretty sure feeding themselves will be a tremendous struggle. Traditionally, the Career tributes’ strategy is to get hold of all the food early on and work from there. The years when they have not protected it well — one year a pack of hideous reptiles destroyed it, another a Gamemakers’ flood washed it away — those are usually the years that tributes from other districts have won. That the Careers have been better fed growing up is actually to their disadvantage, because they don’t know how to be hungry. Not the way Rue and I do</td>

<td>supplies. In fact, I’m just about to reveal myself when a movement catches my eye. Several hundred yards to my right, I see someone emerge from the woods. For a second, I think it’s Rue, but then I recognize Foxface — she’s the one we couldn’t remember this morning — creeping out onto the plain. When she decides it’s safe, she runs for the pyramid, with quick, small steps. Just before she reaches the circle of supplies that have been littered around the pyramid, she stops, searches the ground, and carefully places her feet on a spot. Then she begins to approach the pyramid with strange little hops, sometimes landing on one foot, teetering slightly, sometimes risking a few steps. At one point, she launches up in the air, over a small barrel and lands poised on her tiptoes. But she overshot slightly, and her momentum throws her forward. I hear her give a sharp squeal as her hands hit the ground, but nothing happens. In a moment, she’s regained her feet and continues until she has reached the bulk of the supplies.<br/>So, I’m right about the booby trap, but it’s clearly more complex than I had imagined. I was right about the girl, too. How wily is she to have discovered this path into the food and to be able to replicate it so neatly? She fills her pack, taking a few items from a variety of containers, crackers from a crate, a handful of apples from a burlap sack that hangs suspended from a rope off the side of a bin. But only a handful from each, not enough to tip off that the food is missing. Not enough to cause suspicion. And then she’s doing her odd little dance back out of the circle and scampering into the woods again, safe and sound.<br/>I realize I’m grinding my teeth in frustration. Foxface has confirmed what I’d already guessed. But what sort of trap have they laid that requires such dexterity? Has so many trigger points? Why did she squeal so as her hands made contact with the earth? You’d have thought . . . and slowly it begins to dawn on me . . . you’d have thought the very ground was going to explode.<br/>“It’s mined,” I whisper. That explains everything. The Careers’ willingness to leave their supplies, Foxface’s reaction, the involvement of the boy from District 3, where they have the factories, where they make televisions and automobiles and explosives. But where did he get them? In the supplies? That’s not the sort of weapon the Gamemakers usually provide, given that they like to see the tributes draw blood personally. I </td>

<td>The ground around it has been dug up and patted back down. The land mines were disabled after the sixty seconds we stood on the plates, but the boy from District 3 must have managed to reactivate them. I’ve never seen anyone in the Games do that.

<td>catches him in a headlock from behind. I can see the muscles ripple in Cato’s arms as he sharply jerks the boy’s head to the side.<br/>It’s that quick. The death of the boy from District 3.<br/>The other two Careers seem to be trying to calm Cato down. I can tell he wants to return to the woods, but they keep pointing at the sky, which puzzles me until I realize, Of course. They think whoever set off the explosions is dead<br/> . They don’t know about the arrows and the apples. They assume the booby trap was faulty, but that the tribute who blew up the supplies was killed doing it. If there was a cannon shot, it could have been easily lost in the subsequent explosions. The shattered remains of the thief removed by hovercraft. They retire to the far side of the lake to allow the Gamemakers to retrieve the body of the boy from District 3. And they wait.<br/>I suppose a cannon goes off. A hovercraft appears and takes the dead boy. The sun dips below the horizon. Night falls. Up in the sky, I see the seal and know the anthem must have begun. A moment of darkness. They show the boy from District 3. They show the boy from District 10, who must have died this morning. Then the seal reappears. So, now they know. The bomber survived. In the seal’s light, I can see Cato and the girl from District 2 put on their night-vision glasses. The boy from District 1 ignites a tree branch for a torch, illuminating the grim determination on all their faces. The Careers stride back into the woods to hunt.</td>

<td>Rue!” I shout back, so she knows I’m near. So, they<br/> know I’m near, and hopefully the girl who has attacked them with tracker jackers and gotten an eleven they still can’t explain will be enough to pull their attention away from her. “Rue! I’m coming!”<br/>When I break into the clearing, she’s on the ground, hopelessly entangled in a net. She just has time to reach her hand through the mesh and say my name before the spear enters her body.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The boy from District 1 dies before he can pull out the spear. My arrow drives deeply into the center of his neck. He falls to his knees and halves the brief remainder of his life by yanking out the arrow and drowning in his own blood. I’m reloaded, shifting my aim from side to side, while I shout at Rue, “Are there more? Are there more?”<br/>She has to say no several times before I hear it.<br/>Rue has rolled to her side, her body curved in and around the spear. I shove the boy away from her and pull out my knife, freeing her from the net. One look at the wound and I know it’s far beyond my capacity to heal. Beyond anyone’s probably. The spearhead is buried up to the shaft in her stomach. I crouch before her, staring helplessly at the embedded weapon. There’s no point in comforting words, in telling her she’ll be all right. She’s no fool. Her hand reaches out and I clutch it like a lifeline. As if it’s me who’s dying instead of Rue.<br/>“You blew up the food?” she whispers.<br/>“Every last bit,” I say.<br/>“You have to win,” she says.<br/>“I’m going to. Going to win for both of us now,” I promise. I hear a cannon and look up. It must be for the boy from District 1.<br/>“Don’t go.” Rue tightens her grip on my hand.<br/>“Course not. Staying right here,” I say. I move in closer to her, pulling her</td>

My father pulled me in with that remarkable voice — but I haven’t sung much since he died. Except when Prim is very sick. Then I sing her the same songs she liked as a baby.<br/>Sing. My throat is tight with tears, hoarse from smoke and fatigue. But if this is Prim’s, I mean, Rue’s last request, I have to at least try. The song that comes to me is a simple lullaby, one we sing fretful, hungry babies to sleep with. It’s old, very old I think. Made up long ago in our hills. What my music teacher calls a mountain air. But the words are easy and soothing, promising tomorrow will be more hopeful than this awful piece of time we call today.<br/></td>

<td>Gale’s voice is in my head. His ravings against the Capitol no longer pointless, no longer to be ignored. Rue’s death has forced me to confront my own fury against the cruelty, the injustice they inflict upon us. But here, even more strongly than at home, I feel my impotence. There’s no way to take revenge on the Capitol. Is there?<br/>Then I remember Peeta’s words on the roof. “Only I keep wishing I could think of a way to . . . to show the Capitol they don’t own me. That I’m more than just a piece in their Games.<br/> ” And for the first time, I understand what he means.<br/>I want to do something, right here, right now, to shame them, to make them accountable, to show the Capitol that whatever they do or force us to do there is a part of every tribute they can’t own. That Rue was more than a piece in their Games. And so am I.<br/>A few steps into the woods grows a bank of wildflowers. Perhaps they are really weeds of some sort, but they have blossoms in beautiful shades of violet and yellow and white. I gather up an armful and come back to Rue’s side. Slowly, one stem at a time, I decorate her body in the flowers. Covering the ugly wound. Wreathing her face. Weaving her hair with bright colors.<br/>They’ll have to show it. Or, even if they choose to turn the cameras elsewhere at this moment, they’ll have to bring them back when they collect the bodies and everyone will see her then and know I did it. I step back and take a last look at Rue. She could really be asleep in that meadow after all.<br/>“Bye, Rue,” I whisper. I press the three middle fingers of my left hand against my lips and hold them out in her direction. Then I walk away without looking back.<br/>The birds fall silent. Somewhere, a mockingjay gives the warning whistle that precedes the hovercraft. I don’t know how it knows. It must hear things that humans can’t. I pause, my eyes focused on what’s ahead, not what’s happening behind me. It doesn’t take long, then the general birdsong begins again and I know she’s gone.<br/>Another mockingjay, a young one by the look of it, lands on a branch before me and bursts out Rue’s melody. My song, the hovercraft, were too unfamiliar for this novice to pick up, but it has mastered her handful of notes. The ones that mean she’s safe.<br/>“Good and safe,” I say as I pass under its branch. “We don’t have to worry about her now.” Good and safe.<br/>I’ve no idea where to go. The brief sense of home I had that one night with Rue has vanished. My feet wander this way and that until sunset. I’m not afraid, not even watchful. Which makes me an easy target. Except I’d kill anyone I met on sight. Without emotion or the slightest tremor in my hands. My hatred of the Capitol has not lessened my hatred of my competitors in the least. Especially the Careers. They, at least, can be made to pay for Rue’s death.</td>

<td>I’m about to haul my packs into a tree to make camp when a silver parachute floats down and lands in front of me. A gift from a sponsor. But why now? I’ve been in fairly good shape with supplies. Maybe Haymitch’s noticed my despondency and is trying to cheer me up a bit. Or could it be something to help my ear?<br/>I open the parachute and find a small loaf of bread. It’s not the fine white Capitol stuff. It’s made of dark ration grain and shaped in a crescent. Sprinkled with seeds. I flashback to Peeta’s lesson on the various district breads in the Training Center. This bread came from District 11. I cautiously lift the still warm loaf. What must it have cost the people of District 11 who can’t even feed themselves? How many would’ve had to do without to scrape up a coin to put in the collection for this one loaf? It had been meant for Rue, surely. But instead of pulling the gift when she died, they’d authorized Haymitch to give it to me. As a thank-you? Or because, like me, they don’t like to let debts go unpaid? For whatever reason, this is a first. A district gift to a tribute who’s not your own.<br/>I lift my face and step into the last falling rays of sunlight. “My thanks to the people of District Eleven,” I say. I want them to know I know where it came from. That the full value of their gift has been recognized.<br/></td>

<td>Sometimes when things are particularly bad, my brain will give me a happy dream. A visit with my father in the woods. An hour of sunlight and cake with Prim. Tonight it sends me Rue, still decked in her flowers, perched in a high sea of trees, trying to teach me to talk to the mockingjays. I see no sign of her wounds, no blood, just a bright, laughing girl. She sings songs I’ve never heard in a clear, melodic voice. On and on. Through the night. There’s a drowsy in-between period when I can hear the last few strains of her music although she’s lost in the leaves. When I fully awaken, I’m momentarily comforted. I try to hold on to the peaceful feeling of the dream, but it quickly slips away, leaving me sadder and lonelier than ever.<br/>Heaviness infuses my whole body, as if there’s liquid lead in my veins. I’ve lost the will to do the simplest tasks, to do anything but lie here, staring unblinkingly through the canopy of leaves. For several hours, I remain motionless. As usual, it’s the thought of Prim’s anxious face as she watches me on the screens back home that breaks me from my lethargy.<br/>I give myself a series of simple commands to follow, like “Now you have to sit up, Katniss. Now you have to drink water, Katniss.” I act on the orders with slow, robotic motions. “Now you have to sort the packs, Katniss.”<br/>Rue’s pack holds my sleeping bag, her nearly empty water skin, a handful of nuts and roots, a bit of rabbit, her extra socks, and her slingshot. The boy from District 1 has several knives, two spare spearheads, a flashlight, a small leather pouch, a first-aid kit, a full bottle of water, and a pack of dried fruit. A pack of dried fruit! Out of all he might have chosen from. To me, this is a sign of extreme arrogance. Why bother to carry food when you have such a bounty back at camp? When you will kill your enemies so quickly you’ll be home before you’re hungry? I can only hope the other Careers traveled so lightly when it came to food and now find themselves with nothing.<br/>Speaking of which, my own supply is running low. I finish off the loaf from District 11 and the last of the rabbit. How quickly the food disappears. All I have left are Rue’s roots and nuts, the boy’s dried fruit, and one strip of beef. Now you have to hunt, Katniss,<br/> I tell myself.<br/>I obediently consolidate the supplies I want into my pack. After I climb down the tree, I conceal the boy’s knives and spearheads in a pile of rocks so that no one else can use them. I’ve lost my bearings what with all the wandering around I did yesterday evening, but I try and head back in the general direction of the stream. I know I’m on course when I come across Rue’s third, unlit fire. Shortly thereafter, I discover a flock of grooslings perched in the trees and take out three before they know what hit them. I return to Rue’s signal fire and start it up, not caring about the excessive smoke. Where are you, Cato?<br/> I think as I roast the birds and Rue’s roots. I’m waiting right here.<br/><br/>Who knows where the Careers are now? Either too far to reach me or too sure this is a trick or . . . is</td>

I don’t know why I should even care about the boy.<br/>Then I realize . . . he was my first kill.<br/>Along with other statistics they report to help people place their bets, every tribute has a list of kills. I guess technically I’d get credited for Glimmer and the girl from District 4, too, for dumping that nest on them. But the boy from District 1 was the first person I knew would die because of my actions. Numerous animals have lost their lives at my hands, but only one human. I hear Gale saying, “How different can it be, really?”<br/>Amazingly similar in the execution. A bow pulled, an arrow shot. Entirely different in the aftermath. I killed a boy whose name I don’t even know. Somewhere his family is weeping for him. His friends call for my blood. Maybe he had a girlfriend who really believed he would come back. . . .<br/>But then I think of Rue’s still body and I’m able to banish the boy from my mind. At least, for now</td>

<td> I cover my good ear to block out the strains of the anthem, but then I hear the trumpets and sit straight up in anticipation.<br/>For the most part, the only communication the tributes get from outside the arena is the nightly death toll. But occasionally, there will be trumpets followed by an announcement. Usually, this will be a call to a feast. When food is scarce, the Gamemakers will invite the players to a banquet, somewhere known to all like the Cornucopia, as an inducement to gather and fight. Sometimes there is a feast and sometimes there’s nothing but a loaf of stale bread for the tributes to compete for. I wouldn’t go in for the food, but this could be an ideal time to take out a few competitors.<br/>Claudius Templesmith’s voice booms down from overhead, congratulating the six of us who remain. But he is not inviting us to a feast. He’s saying something very confusing. There’s been a rule change in the Games. A rule change! That in itself is mind bending since we don’t really have any rules to speak of except don’t step off your circle for sixty seconds and the unspoken rule about not eating one another. Under the new rule, both tributes from the same district will be declared winners if they are the last two alive. Claudius pauses, as if he knows we’re not getting it, and repeats the change again.<br/>The news sinks in. Two tributes can win this year. If they’re from the same district. Both can live. Both of us can live.<br/>Before I can stop myself, I call out Peeta’s name.</td>

And the voice was hoarse and weak. Still, it must have been Peeta. Who else in the arena would call me sweetheart? My eyes peruse the bank, but there’s nothing. Just mud, the plants, the base of the rocks.<br/>“Peeta?” I whisper. “Where are you?” There’s no answer. Could I just have imagined it? No, I’m certain it was real and very close at hand, too. “Peeta?” I creep along the bank.<br/>“Well, don’t step on me.”<br/>I jump back. His voice was right under my feet. Still there’s nothing. Then his eyes open, unmistakably blue in the brown mud and green leaves. I gasp and am rewarded with a hint of white teeth as he laughs.<br/>It’s the final word in camouflage. Forget chucking weights around. Peeta should have gone into his private session with the Gamemakers and painted himself into a tree. Or a boulder. Or a muddy bank full of weeds.<br/>“Close your eyes again,” I order. He does, and his mouth, too, and completely disappears. Most of what I judge to be his body is actually under a layer of mud and plants. His face and arms are so artfully disguised as to be invisible. I kneel beside him. “I guess all those hours decorating cakes paid off.”<br/>Peeta smiles. “Yes, frosting. The final defense of the dying.”<br/>“You’re not going to die,” I tell him firmly.<br/>“Says who?” His voice is so ragged.<br/>“Says me. We’re on the same team now, you know,” I tell him.<br/>His eyes open. “So, I heard. Nice of you to find what’s left of me.”<br/>I pull out my water bottle and give him a drink. “Did Cato cut you?” I ask.<br/>“Left leg. Up high,” he answers.<br/>“Let’s get you in the stream, wash you off so I can see what kind of wounds you’ve got,” I say.<br/>“Lean down a minute first,” he says. “Need to tell you something.” I lean over and put my good ear to his lips, which tickle as he whispers. “Remember, we’re madly in love, so it’s all right to kiss me anytime you feel like it.”<br/>I jerk my head back but end up laughing. “Thanks, I’ll keep it in mind.”</td>

<td>Then I apply the burn cream to his chest. This is when I notice how hot his skin is becoming. The layer of mud and the bottles of water have disguised the fact that he’s burning with fever. I dig through the first-aid kit I got from the boy from District 1 and find pills that reduce your temperature. My mother actually breaks down and buys these on occasion when her home remedies fail.<br/>“Swallow these,” I tell him, and he obediently takes the medicine. “You must be hungry.”<br/>“Not really. It’s funny, I haven’t been hungry for days,” says Peeta. In fact, when I offer him groosling, he wrinkles his nose at it and turns away. That’s when I know how sick he is.<br/>“Peeta, we need to get some food in you,” I insist.<br/>“It’ll just come right back up,” he says. The best I can do is to get him to eat a few bits of dried apple. “Thanks. I’m much better, really. Can I sleep now, Katniss?” he asks.<br/>“Soon,” I promise. “I need to look at your leg first.” Trying to be as gentle as I can, I remove his boots, his socks, and then very slowly inch his pants off of him. I can see the tear Cato’s sword made in the fabric over his thigh, but it in no way prepares me for what lies underneath. The deep inflamed gash oozing both blood and pus. The swelling of the leg. And worst of all, the smell of festering flesh.<br/>I want to run away. Disappear into the woods like I did that day they brought the burn victim to our house. Go and hunt while my mother and Prim attend to what I have neither the skill nor the courage to face. But there’s no one here but me. I try to capture the calm demeanor my mother assumes when handling particularly bad cases.<br/>“Pretty awful, huh?” says Peeta. He’s watching me closely.<br/>“So-so.” I shrug like it’s no big deal. “You should see some of the people they bring my mother from the mines.” I refrain from saying how I usually clear out of the house whenever she’s treating anything worse than a cold. Come to think of it, I don’t even much like to be around coughing. “First thing is to clean it well.”<br/>I’ve left on Peeta’s undershorts because they’re not in bad shape and I don’t want to pull them over the swollen thigh and, all right, maybe the idea of him being naked makes me uncomfortable. That’s another thing about my mother and Prim. Nakedness has no effect on them, gives them no cause for embarrassment. Ironically, at this point in the Games, my little sister would be of far more use to Peeta than I am. I scoot my square of plastic under him so I can wash down the rest of him. With each bottle I pour over him, the worse the wound looks. The rest of his lower body has fared pretty well, just one tracker jacker sting and a few small burns that I treat quickly. But the gash on his leg . . . what on earth can I do for that?<br/>“Why don’t we give it some air and then . . .” I trail</td>

<td>We’re going to have to experiment some,” I admit. I know the tracker jacker leaves draw out infection, so I start with those. Within minutes of pressing the handful of chewed-up green stuff into the wound, pus begins running down the side of his leg. I tell myself this is a good thing and bite the inside of my cheek hard because my breakfast is threatening to make a reappearance.<br/>“Katniss?” Peeta says. I meet his eyes, knowing my face must be some shade of green. He mouths the words. “How about that kiss?”<br/>I burst out laughing because the whole thing is so revolting I can’t stand it.<br/>“Something wrong?” he asks a little too innocently.<br/>“I . . . I’m no good at this. I’m not my mother. I’ve no idea what I’m doing and I hate pus,” I say. “Euh!” I allow myself to let out a groan as I rinse away the first round of leaves and apply the second. “Euuuh!”<br/>“How do you hunt?” he asks.<br/>“Trust me. Killing things is much easier than this,” I said. “Although for all I know, I am killing you.”<br/>“Can you speed it up a little?” he asks.<br/>“No. Shut up and eat your pears,” I say.<br/>After three applications and what seems like a bucket of pus, the wound does look better. Now that the swelling has gone down, I can see how deep Cato’s sword cut. Right down to the bone.</td>

He must be feeling a bit better if he can throw.<br/>“You know, you’re kind of squeamish for such a lethal person,” says Peeta as I beat the shorts clean between two rocks. “I wish I’d let you give Haymitch a shower after all.”<br/></td>

I didn’t drain all that pus for nothing,” I say.<br/>“I know.

This is probably overdue anyway since he’s right, we are supposed to be madly in love.

He’s great at this stuff.<br/>I hold up the pot. “Peeta, look what Haymitch has sent you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Getting the broth into Peeta takes an hour of coaxing, begging, threatening, and yes, kissing, but finally, sip by sip, he empties the pot. I let him drift off to sleep then and attend to my own needs, wolfing down a supper of groosling and roots while I watch the daily report in the sky. No new casualties. Still, Peeta and I have given the audience a fairly interesting day. Hopefully, the Gamemakers will allow us a peaceful night.<br/></td>

<td>I spend the night half-sitting, half-lying next to Peeta, refreshing the bandage, and trying not to dwell on the fact that by teaming up with him, I’ve made myself far more vulnerable than when I was alone. Tethered to the ground, on guard, with a very sick person to take care of. But I knew he was injured. And still I came after him. I’m just going to have to trust that whatever instinct sent me to find him was a good one.<br/>When the sky turns rosy, I notice the sheen of sweat on Peeta’s lip and discover the fever has broken. He’s not back to normal, but it’s come down a few degrees. Last night, when I was gathering vines, I came upon a bush of Rue’s berries. I strip off the fruit and mash it up in the broth pot with cold water.<br/>Peeta’s struggling to get up when I reach the cave. “I woke up and you were gone,” he says. “I was worried about you.”<br/>I have to laugh as I ease him back down. “You were worried about me? Have you taken a look at yourself lately?”<br/>“I thought Cato and Clove might have found you. They like to hunt at night,” he says, still serious.<br/></td>

<td>Oh, right, the whole romance thing. I reach out to touch his cheek and he catches my hand and presses it against his lips. I remember my father doing this very thing to my mother and I wonder where Peeta picked it up. Surely not from his father and the witch.<br/>“No more kisses for you until you’ve eaten,” I say.<br/>We get him propped up against the wall and he obediently swallows the spoonfuls of the berry mush I feed him. He refuses the groosling again, though.<br/>“You didn’t sleep,” Peeta says.<br/>“I’m all right,” I say. But the truth is, I’m exhausted.<br/>“Sleep now. I’ll keep watch. I’ll wake you if anything happens,” he says. I hesitate. “Katniss, you can’t stay up forever.”<br/>He’s got a point there. I’ll have to sleep eventually. And probably better to do it now when he seems relatively alert and we have daylight on our side. “All right,” I say. “But just for a few hours. Then you wake me.”<br/>It’s too warm for the sleeping bag now. I smooth it out on the cave floor and lie down, one hand on my loaded bow in case I have to shoot at a moment’s notice. Peeta sits beside me, leaning against the wall, his bad leg stretched out before him, his eyes trained on the world outside. “Go to sleep,” he says softly. His hand brushes the loose strands of my hair off my forehead. Unlike the staged kisses and caresses so far, this gesture seems natural and comforting. I don’t want him to stop and he doesn’t. He’s still stroking my hair when I fall asleep.<br/>Too long. I sleep too long. I know from the moment I open my eyes that we’re into the afternoon. Peeta’s right beside me, his position unchanged. I sit up, feeling somehow defensive but better rested than I’ve been in days.<br/>“Peeta, you were supposed to wake me after a couple of hours,” I say.<br/>“For what? Nothing’s going on here,” he says. “Besides I like watching you sleep. You don’t scowl. Improves your looks a lot.”<br/>This, of course, brings on a scowl that makes him grin. That’s when I notice how dry his lips are. I test his cheek. Hot as a coal stove. He claims he’s been drinking, but the containers still feel full to me. I give him more fever pills and stand over him while he drinks first one, then a second quart of water. Then I tend to his minor wounds, the burns, the stings, which are showing improvement. I steel myself and unwrap the leg.</td>

<td>My heart drops into my stomach. It’s worse, much worse. There’s no more pus in evidence, but the swelling has increased and the tight shiny skin is inflamed. Then I see the red streaks starting to crawl up his leg. Blood poisoning. Unchecked, it will kill him for sure. My chewed-up leaves and ointment won’t make a dent in it. We’ll need strong anti-infection drugs from the Capitol. I can’t imagine the cost of such potent medicine. If Haymitch pooled every donation from every sponsor, would he have enough? I doubt it. Gifts go up in price the longer the Games continue. What buys a full meal on day one buys a cracker on day twelve. And the kind of medicine Peeta needs would have been at a premium from the beginning.<br/>“Well, there’s more swelling, but the pus is gone,” I say in an unsteady voice.<br/>“I know what blood poisoning is, Katniss,” says Peeta. “Even if my mother isn’t a healer.”<br/>“You’re just going to have to outlast the others, Peeta. They’ll cure it back at the Capitol when we win,” I say.<br/>“Yes, that’s a good plan,” he says. But I feel this is mostly for my benefit.</td>

<td>This is where I really got the money for the goat, but I tell Peeta I sold an old silver locket of my mother’s. That can’t hurt anyone. Then I pick up the story in the late afternoon of Prim’s birthday.<br/>Gale and I went to the market on the square so that I could buy dress materials. As I was running my fingers over a length of thick blue cotton cloth, something caught my eye. There’s an old man who keeps a small herd of goats on the other side of the Seam. I don’t know his real name, everyone just calls him the Goat Man. His joints are swollen and twisted in painful angles, and he’s got a hacking cough that proves he spent years in the mines. But he’s lucky. Somewhere along the way he saved up enough for these goats and now has something to do in his old age besides slowly starve to death. He’s filthy and impatient, but the goats are clean and their milk is rich if you can afford it.<br/>One of the goats, a white one with black patches, was lying down in a cart. It was easy to see why. Something, probably a dog, had mauled her shoulder and infection had set in. It was bad, the Goat Man had to hold her up to milk her. But I thought I knew someone who could fix it.<br/>“Gale,” I whispered. “I want that goat for Prim.”<br/>Owning a nanny goat can change your life in District 12. The animals can live off almost anything, the Meadow’s a perfect feeding place, and they can give four quarts of milk a day. To drink, to make into cheese, to sell. It’s not even against the law.<br/>“She’s hurt pretty bad,” said Gale. “We better take a closer look.”<br/>We went over and bought a cup of milk to share, then stood over the goat as if idly curious.<br/>“Let her be,” said the man.<br/>“Just looking,” said Gale.<br/>“Well, look fast. She goes to the butcher soon. Hardly anyone will buy her milk, and then they only pay half price,” said the man.<br/>“What’s the butcher giving for her?” I asked.<br/>The man shrugged. “Hang around and see.” I turned and saw Rooba coming across the square toward us. “Lucky thing you showed up,” said the Goat Man when she arrived. “Girl’s got her eye on your goat.”<br/>“Not if she’s spoken for,” I said carelessly.<br/>Rooba looked me up and down then frowned at the goat. “She’s not. Look at that shoulder. Bet you half the carcass will be too rotten for even sausage.”<br/>“What?” said the Goat Man. “We had a deal.”<br/>“We had a deal on an animal with a few teeth marks. Not that thing. Sell her to the girl if she’s stupid enough to take her,” said Rooba. As she marched off, I caught her wink.<br/>The Goat Man was mad, but he still wanted that goat off his hands. It took us half an hour to agree on the price. Quite a crowd had gathered by then to hand out opinions. It was an excellent deal if the goat lived; I’d been robbed if she died. People took sides in the argument, but I took the goat.<br/>Gale offered to carry her. I think he wanted to see the look on Prim’s face as much as I did. In a moment of complete giddiness, I bought a pink ribbon and tied it around her neck. Then we hurried back to my house.<br/>You should have seen Prim’s reaction when we walked in with that goat. Remember this is a girl who wept to save that awful old cat, Buttercup. She was so excited she started crying and laughing all at once. My mother was less sure, seeing the injury, but the pair of them went to work on it, grinding up herbs and coaxing brews down the animal’s throat.<br/>“They sound like you,” says Peeta. I had almost forgotten he was there.<br/>“Oh, no, Peeta. They work magic. That thing couldn’t have died if it tried,” I say. But then I bite my tongue, realizing what that must sound like to Peeta, who is dying, in my incompetent hands.<br/>“Don’t worry. I’m not trying,” he jokes. “Finish the story.”<br/>“Well, that’s it. Only I remember that night, Prim insisted on sleeping with Lady on a blanket next to the fire. And just before they drifted off, the goat licked her cheek, like it was giving her a good night kiss or something,” I say. “It was already mad about her.”<br/>“Was it still wearing the pink ribbon?” he asks.<br/>“I think so,” I say. “Why?”<br/>“I’m just trying to get a picture,” he says thoughtfully. “I can see why that day made you happy.”<br/>“Well, I knew that goat would be a little gold mine,” I say.<br/>“Yes, of course I was referring to that, not the lasting joy you gave the sister you love so much you took her place in the reaping,” says Peeta drily.<br/>“The goat has<br/> paid for itself. Several times over,” I say in a superior tone.<br/>“Well, it wouldn’t dare do anything else after you saved its life,” says Peeta. “I intend to do the same thing.”<br/>“Really? What did you cost me again?” I ask.</td>

<td>“A lot of trouble. Don’t worry. You’ll get it all back,” he says.<br/>“You’re not making sense,” I say. I test his forehead. The fever’s going nowhere but up. “You’re a little cooler though.”<br/>The sound of the trumpets startles me. I’m on my feet and at the mouth of the cave in a flash, not wanting to miss a syllable. It’s my new best friend, Claudius Templesmith, and as I expected, he’s inviting us to a feast. Well, we’re not that hungry and I actually wave his offer away in indifference when he says, “Now hold on. Some of you may already be declining my invitation. But this is no ordinary feast. Each of you needs something desperately.”<br/>I do need something desperately. Something to heal Peeta’s leg.<br/>“Each of you will find that something in a backpack, marked with your district number, at the Cornucopia at dawn. Think hard about refusing to show up. For some of you, this will be your last chance,” says Claudius.<br/>There’s nothing else, just his words hanging in the air. I jump as Peeta grips my shoulder from behind. “No,” he says. “You’re not risking your life for me.”<br/>“Who said I was?” I say.<br/>“So, you’re not going?” he asks.<br/>“Of course, I’m not going. Give me some credit. Do you think I’m running straight into some free-for-all against Cato and Clove and Thresh? Don’t be stupid,” I say, helping him back to bed. “I’ll let them fight it out, we’ll see who’s in the sky tomorrow night and work out a plan from there.”<br/>“You’re such a bad liar, Katniss. I don’t know how you’ve survived this long.” He begins to mimic me. “I knew that goat would be a little gold mine. You’re a little cooler though. Of course, I’m not going<br/> .” He shakes his head. “Never gamble at cards. You’ll lose your last coin,” he says.<br/>Anger flushes my face. “All right, I am going, and you can’t stop me!”<br/>“I can follow you. At least partway. I may not make it to the Cornucopia, but if I’m yelling your name, I bet someone can find me. And then I’ll be dead for sure,” he says.<br/>“You won’t get a hundred yards from here on that leg,” I say.<br/>“Then I’ll drag myself,” says Peeta. “You go and I’m going, too.”<br/></td>

<td>I’m so lost in thought that I almost miss the parachute, even though it floats right by me. Then I spring after it, yanking it from the water, tearing off the silver fabric to retrieve the vial. Haymitch has done it! He’s gotten the medicine — I don’t know how, persuaded some gaggle of romantic fools to sell their jewels — and I can save Peeta! It’s such a tiny vial though. It must be very strong to cure someone as ill as Peeta. A ripple of doubt runs through me. I uncork the vial and take a deep sniff. My spirits fall at the sickly sweet scent. Just to be sure, I place a drop on the tip of my tongue. There’s no question, it’s sleep syrup. It’s a common medicine in District 12. Cheap, as medicine goes, but very addictive. Almost everyone’s had a dose at one time or another. We have some in a bottle at home. My mother gives it to hysterical patients to knock them out to stitch up a bad wound or quiet their minds or just to help someone in pain get through the night. It only takes a little. A vial this size could knock Peeta out for a full day, but what good is that? I’m so furious I’m about to throw Haymitch’s last offering into the stream when it hits me. A full day? That’s more than I need.<br/>I mash up a handful of berries so the taste won’t be as noticeable and add some mint leaves for good measure. Then I head back up to the cave. “I’ve brought you a treat. I found a new patch of berries a little farther downstream.”<br/>Peeta opens his mouth for the first bite without hesitation. He swallows then frowns slightly. “They’re very sweet.”<br/>“Yes, they’re sugar berries. My mother makes jam from them. Haven’t you ever had them before?” I say, poking the next spoonful in his mouth.<br/>“No,” he says, almost puzzled. “But they taste familiar. Sugar berries?”<br/>“Well, you can’t get them in the market much, they only grow wild,” I say. Another mouthful goes down. Just one more to go.<br/>“They’re sweet as syrup,” he says, taking the last spoonful. “Syrup.” His eyes widen as he realizes the truth. I clamp my hand over his mouth and nose hard, forcing him to swallow instead of spit. He tries to make himself vomit the stuff up, but it’s too late, he’s already losing consciousness. Even as he fades away, I can see in his eyes what I’ve done is unforgivable.<br/>I sit back on my heels and look at him with a mixture of sadness and satisfaction. A stray berry stains his chin and I wipe it away. “Who can’t lie, Peeta?” I say, even though he can’t hear me.<br/>It doesn’t matter. The rest of Panem can.</td>

<td>boy slides into view, and after an initial jolt of alarm, I feel better. “Peeta.”<br/>“Hey,” he says. “Good to see your eyes again.”<br/>“How long have I been out?” I ask.<br/>“Not sure. I woke up yesterday evening and you were lying next to me in a very scary pool of blood,” he says. “I think it’s stopped finally, but I wouldn’t sit up or anything.”<br/>I gingerly lift my hand to my head and find it bandaged. This simple gesture leaves me weak and dizzy. Peeta holds a bottle to my lips and I drink thirstily.<br/>“You’re better,” I say.<br/>“Much better. Whatever you shot into my arm did the trick,” he says. “By this morning, almost all the swelling in my leg was gone.”<br/>He doesn’t seem angry about my tricking him, drugging him, and running off to the feast. Maybe I’m just too beat-up and I’ll hear about it later when I’m stronger. But for the moment, he’s all gentleness.<br/>“Did you eat?” I ask.<br/>“I’m sorry to say I gobbled down three pieces of that groosling before I realized it might have to last a while. Don’t worry, I’m back on a strict diet,” he says.<br/>“No, it’s good. You need to eat. I’ll go hunting soon,” I say.<br/>“Not too soon, all right?” he says. “You just let me take care of you for a while.”<br/>I don’t really seem to have much choice. Peeta feeds me bites of groosling and raisins and makes me drink plenty of water. He rubs some warmth back into my feet and wraps them in his jacket before tucking the sleeping bag back up around my chin.<br/>“Your boots and socks are still damp and the weather’s not helping much,” he says. There’s a clap of thunder, and I see lightning electrify the sky through an opening in the rocks. Rain drips through several holes in the ceiling, but Peeta has built a sort of canopy over my head and upper body by wedging the square of plastic into the rocks above me.<br/>“I wonder what brought on this storm? I mean, who’s the target?” says Peeta.</td>

I can’t help, for a moment, comparing him with Gale, who would see that field as a potential source of food as well as a threat. Thresh certainly did. It’s not that Peeta’s soft exactly, and he’s proved he’s not a coward. But there are things you don’t question too much, I guess, when your home always smells like baking bread, whereas Gale questions everything.

<td> wonder what we’d have to do to get Haymitch to send us some bread.”<br/>I raise my eyebrows before I remember he doesn’t know about the message Haymitch sent us a couple of nights ago. One kiss equals one pot of broth. It’s not the sort of thing I can blurt out, either. To say my thoughts aloud would be tipping off the audience that the romance has been fabricated to play on their sympathies and that would result in no food at all. Somehow, believably, I’ve got to get things back on track. Something simple to start with. I reach out and take his hand.<br/>“Well, he probably used up a lot of resources helping me knock you out,” I say mischievously.<br/>“Yeah, about that,” says Peeta, entwining his fingers in mine. “Don’t try something like that again.”<br/>“Or what?” I ask.<br/>“Or . . . or . . .” He can’t think of anything good. “Just give me a minute.”<br/>“What’s the problem?” I say with a grin.<br/>“The problem is we’re both still alive. Which only reinforces the idea in your mind that you did the right thing,” says Peeta.<br/>“I did do the right thing,” I say.<br/>“No! Just don’t, Katniss!” His grip tightens, hurting my hand, and there’s real anger in his voice. “Don’t die for me. You won’t be doing me any favors. All right?”<br/>I’m startled by his intensity but recognize an excellent opportunity for getting food, so I try to keep up. “Maybe I did it for myself, Peeta, did you ever think of that? Maybe you aren’t the only one who . . . who worries about . . . what it would be like if . . .”<br/>I fumble. I’m not as smooth with words as Peeta. And while I was talking, the idea of actually losing Peeta hit me again and I realized how much I don’t want him to die. And it’s not about the sponsors. And it’s not about what will happen back home. And it’s not just that I don’t want to be alone. It’s him. I do not want to lose the boy with the bread.<br/>“If what, Katniss?” he says softly.<br/>I wish I could pull the shutters closed, blocking out this moment from the prying eyes of Panem. Even if it means losing food. Whatever I’m feeling, it’s no one’s business but mine.<br/>“That’s exactly the kind of topic Haymitch told me to steer clear of,” I say evasively, although Haymitch never said anything of the kind. In fact, he’s probably cursing me out right now for dropping the ball during such an emotionally charged moment. But Peeta somehow catches it.<br/>“Then I’ll just have to fill in the blanks myself,” he says, and moves in to me.<br/>This is the first kiss that we’re both fully aware of. Neither of us hobbled by sickness or pain or simply unconscious. Our lips neither burning with fever or icy cold. This is the first kiss where I actually feel stirring inside my chest. Warm and curious. This is the first kiss that makes me want another.</td>

But he won’t agree unless I’m in the bag, too, and I’m shivering so hard that it’s pointless to object. In stark contrast to two nights ago, when I felt Peeta was a million miles away, I’m struck by his immediacy now. As we settle in, he pulls my head down to use his arm as a pillow; the other rests protectively over me even when he goes to sleep. No one has held me like this in such a long time.

<td> My instincts tell me Haymitch isn’t just looking for physical affection, he wants something more personal. The sort of stuff he was trying to get me to tell about myself when we were practicing for the interview. I’m rotten at it, but Peeta’s not. Maybe the best approach is to get him talking.<br/>“Peeta,” I say lightly. “You said at the interview you’d had a crush on me forever. When did forever start?”<br/>“Oh, let’s see. I guess the first day of school. We were five. You had on a red plaid dress and your hair . . . it was in two braids instead of one. My father pointed you out when we were waiting to line up,” Peeta says.<br/>“Your father? Why?” I ask.<br/>“He said, ‘See that little girl? I wanted to marry her mother, but she ran off with a coal miner,’” Peeta says.<br/>“What? You’re making that up!” I exclaim.<br/>“No, true story,” Peeta says. “And I said, ‘A coal miner? Why did she want a coal miner if she could’ve had you?’ And he said, ‘Because when he sings . . . even the birds stop to listen.’”<br/>“That’s true. They do. I mean, they did,” I say. I’m stunned and surprisingly moved, thinking of the baker telling this to Peeta. It strikes me that my own reluctance to sing, my own dismissal of music might not really be that I think it’s a waste of time. It might be because it reminds me too much of my father.<br/>“So that day, in music assembly, the teacher asked who knew the valley song. Your hand shot right up in the air. She stood you up on a stool and had you sing it for us. And I swear, every bird outside the windows fell silent,” Peeta says.<br/>“Oh, please,” I say, laughing.<br/>“No, it happened. And right when your song ended, I knew — just like your mother — I was a goner,” Peeta says. “Then for the next eleven years, I tried to work up the nerve to talk to you.”<br/>“Without success,” I add.<br/>“Without success. So, in a way, my name being drawn in the reaping was a real piece of luck,” says Peeta.</td>

But Peeta’s story has a ring of truth to it. That part about my father and the birds. And I did sing the first day of school, although I don’t remember the song. And that red plaid dress . . . there was one, a hand-me-down to Prim that got washed to rags after my father’s death.<br/>It would explain another thing, too. Why Peeta took a beating to give me the bread on that awful hollow day. So, if those details are true . . . could it all be true?<br/>“You have a . . . remarkable memory,” I say haltingly.<br/>“I remember everything about you,” says Peeta, tucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear. “You’re the one who wasn’t paying attention.”<br/>“I am now,” I say.<br/>“Well, I don’t have much competition here,” he says.<br/>I want to draw away, to close those shutters again, but I know I can’t. It’s as if I can hear Haymitch whispering in my ear, “Say it! Say it!”<br/>I swallow hard and get the words out. “You don’t have much competition anywhere.” And this time, it’s me who leans in.<br/>Our lips have just barely touched when the clunk outside makes us jump. My bow comes up, the arrow ready to fly, but there’s no other sound. Peeta peers through the rocks and then gives a whoop. Before I can stop him, he’s out in the rain, then handing something in to me. A silver parachute attached to a basket. I rip it open at once and inside there’s a feast — fresh rolls, goat cheese, apples, and best of all, a tureen of that incredible lamb stew on wild rice. The very dish I told Caesar Flickerman was the most impressive thing the Capitol had to offer.<br/>Peeta wriggles back inside, his face lit up like the sun. “I guess Haymitch finally got tired of watching us starve.”<br/>“I guess so,” I answer.<br/>But in my head I can hear Haymitch’s smug, if slightly exasperated, words, “Yes, that’s<br/> what I’m looking for, sweetheart.”<br/><br/><br/></td>

But that’s mainly because you didn’t try to run when he set you on fire,” says Peeta. “On the other hand, Haymitch . . . well, if I were you, I’d avoid Haymitch completely. He hates you.”<br/>“I thought you said I was his favorite,” I say.<br/>“He hates me more,” says Peeta. “I don’t think people in general are his sort of thing.”<br/>I know the audience will enjoy our having fun at Haymitch’s expense. He has been around so long, he’s practically an old friend to some of them. And after his head-dive off the stage at the reaping, everybody knows him. By this time, they’ll have dragged him out of the control room for interviews about us. No telling what sort of lies he’s made up. He’s at something of a disadvantage because most mentors have a partner, another victor to help them whereas Haymitch has to be ready to go into action at any moment. Kind of like me when I was alone in the arena. I wonder how he’s holding up, with the drinking, the attention, and the stress of trying to keep us alive.<br/>It’s funny. Haymitch and I don’t get along well in person, but maybe Peeta is right about us being alike because he seems able to communicate with me by the timing of his gifts. Like how I knew I must be close to water when he withheld it and how I knew the sleep syrup just wasn’t something to ease Peeta’s pain and how I know now that I have to play up the romance. He hasn’t made much effort to connect with Peeta really. Perhaps he thinks a bowl of broth would just be a bowl of broth to Peeta, whereas I’ll see the strings attached to it.<br/>A thought hits me, and I’m amazed the question’s taken so long to surface. Maybe it’s because I’ve only recently begun to view Haymitch with a degree of curiosity. “How do you think he did it?”<br/>“Who? Did what?” Peeta asks.<br/>“Haymitch. How do you think he won the Games?” I say.<br/>Peeta considers this quite a while before he answers. Haymitch is sturdily built, but no physical wonder like Cato or Thresh. He’s not particularly handsome. Not in the way that causes sponsors to rain gifts on you. And he’s so surly, it’s hard to imagine anyone teaming up with him. There’s only one way Haymitch could have won, and Peeta says it just as I’m reaching this conclusion myself.<br/>“He outsmarted the others,” says Peeta.<br/>I nod, then let the conversation drop. But secretly I’m wondering if Haymitch sobered up long enough to help Peeta and me because he thought we just might have the wits to survive. Maybe he wasn’t always a drunk. Maybe, in the beginning, he tried to help the tributes. But then it got unbearable. It must be hell to mentor two kids and then watch them die. Year after year after year. I realize that if I get out of here, that will become my job. To mentor the girl from District 12. The idea is so repellent, I thrust it from my mind.<br/></td>

Of course, practically everything we eat is stale,” says Peeta, pulling the sleeping bag up around him. In less than a minute, he’s snoring.<br/>Huh. I always assumed the shopkeepers live a soft life. And it’s true, Peeta has always had enough to eat. But there’s something kind of depressing about living your life on stale bread, the hard, dry loaves that no one else wanted.

<td>“Count me in,” Peeta says. But I can see he’s surprised when I divide the rest of the stew and rice and hand a heaping plate to him. “All this?”<br/>“We’ll earn it back today,” I say, and we both plow into our plates. Even cold, it’s one of the best things I’ve ever tasted. I abandon my fork and scrape up the last dabs of gravy with my finger. “I can feel Effie Trinket shuddering at my manners.”<br/>“Hey, Effie, watch this!” says Peeta. He tosses his fork over his shoulder and literally licks his plate clean with his tongue making loud, satisfied sounds. Then he blows a kiss out to her in general and calls, “We miss you, Effie!”<br/>I cover his mouth with my hand, but I’m laughing. “Stop! Cato could be right outside our cave.”<br/>He grabs my hand away. “What do I care? I’ve got you to protect me now,” says Peeta, pulling me to him.<br/>“Come on,” I say in exasperation, extricating myself from his grasp but not before he gets in another kiss.<br/>Once we’re packed up and standing outside our cave, our mood shifts to serious. It’s as though for the last few days, sheltered by the rocks and the rain and Cato’s preoccupation with Thresh, we were given a respite, a holiday of sorts. Now, although the day is sunny and warm, we both sense we’re really back in the Games. I hand Peeta my knife, since whatever weapons he once had are long gone, and he slips it into his belt. My last seven arrows — of the twelve I sacrificed three in the explosion, two at the feast — rattle a bit too loosely in the quiver. I can’t afford to lose any more.</td>

<td>Needless to say, although it takes several hours to reach my old camp with Rue, I’ve shot nothing. If the stream would settle down, fish might be an option, but the current is still too strong. As we stop to rest and drink water, I try to work out a solution. Ideally, I’d dump Peeta now with some simple root-gathering chore and go hunt, but then he’d be left with only a knife to defend himself against Cato’s spears and superior strength. So what I’d really like is to try and conceal him somewhere safe, then go hunt, and come back and collect him. But I have a feeling his ego isn’t going to go for that suggestion.<br/>“Katniss,” he says. “We need to split up. I know I’m chasing away the game.”<br/>“Only because your leg’s hurt,” I say generously, because really, you can tell that’s only a small part of the problem.<br/>“I know,” he says. “So, why don’t you go on? Show me some plants to gather and that way we’ll both be useful.”<br/>“Not if Cato comes and kills you.” I tried to say it in a nice way, but it still sounds like I think he’s a weakling.<br/>Surprisingly, he just laughs. “Look, I can handle Cato. I fought him before, didn’t I?”<br/>Yeah, and that turned out great. You ended up dying in a mud bank. That’s what I want to say, but I can’t. He did save my life by taking on Cato after all. I try another tactic. “What if you climbed up in a tree and acted as a lookout while I hunted?” I say, trying to make it sound like very important work.<br/>“What if you show me what’s edible around here and go get us some meat?” he says, mimicking my tone. “Just don’t go far, in case you need help.”<br/>I sigh and show him some roots to dig. We do need food, no question. One apple, two rolls, and a blob of cheese the size of a plum won’t last long. I’ll just go a short distance and hope Cato is a long way off.</td>

<td>As I travel the short distance back, I realize we haven’t exchanged signals in a while. When my whistle receives no response, I run. In no time, I find the pack, a neat pile of roots beside it. The sheet of plastic has been laid on the ground where the sun can reach the single layer of berries that covers it. But where is he?<br/>“Peeta!” I call out in a panic. “Peeta!” I turn to the rustle of brush and almost send an arrow through him. Fortunately, I pull my bow at the last second and it sticks in an oak trunk to his left. He jumps back, flinging a handful of berries into the foliage.<br/>My fear comes out as anger. “What are you doing? You’re supposed to be here, not running around in the woods!”<br/>“I found some berries down by the stream,” he says, clearly confused by my outburst.<br/>“I whistled. Why didn’t you whistle back?” I snap at him.<br/>“I didn’t hear. The water’s too loud, I guess,” he says. He crosses and puts his hands on my shoulders. That’s when I feel that I’m trembling.<br/>“I thought Cato killed you!” I almost shout.<br/>“No, I’m fine.” Peeta wraps his arms around me, but I don’t respond. “Katniss?”<br/>I push away, trying to sort out my feelings. “If two people agree on a signal, they stay in range. Because if one of them doesn’t answer, they’re in trouble, all right?”<br/>“All right!” he says.<br/>“All right. Because that’s what happened with Rue, and I watched her die!” I say. I turn away from him, go to the pack and open a fresh bottle of water, although I still have some in mine. But I’m not ready to forgive him. I notice the food. The rolls and apples are untouched, but someone’s definitely picked away part of the cheese. “And you ate without me!” I really don’t care, I just want something else to be mad about.<br/>“What? No, I didn’t,” Peeta says.<br/>“Oh, and I suppose the apples ate the cheese,” I say.<br/>“I don’t know what ate the cheese,” Peeta says slowly and distinctly, as if trying not to lose his temper, “but it wasn’t me. I’ve been down by the stream collecting berries. Would you care for some?”<br/>I would actually, but I don’t want to relent too soon. I do walk over and look at them. I’ve never seen this type before. No, I have. But not in the arena. These aren’t Rue’s berries, although they resemble them. Nor do they match any I learned about in training. I lean down and scoop up a few, rolling them between my fingers.<br/>My father’s voice comes back to me. “Not these, Katniss. Never these. They’re nightlock. You’ll be dead before they reach your stomach.”<br/>Just then, the cannon fires. I whip around, expecting Peeta to collapse to the ground, but he only raises his eyebrows. The hovercraft appears a hundred yards or so away. What’s left of Foxface’s emaciated body is lifted into the air. I can see the red glint of her hair in the sunlight.<br/>I should have known the moment I saw the missing cheese. . . .<br/>Peeta has me by the arm, pushing me toward a tree. “Climb. He’ll be here in a second. We’ll stand a better chance fighting him from above.”<br/>I stop him, suddenly calm. “No, Peeta, she’s your kill, not Cato’s.”<br/>“What? I haven’t even seen her since the first day,” he says. “How could I have killed her?”<br/>In answer, I hold out the berries</td>

Well, she was. Until you outfoxed her.”<br/>“Not on purpose. Doesn’t seem fair somehow. I mean, we would have both been dead, too, if she hadn’t eaten the berries first.” He checks himself. “No, of course, we wouldn’t. You recognized them, didn’t you?”<br/>I give a nod. “We call them nightlock.”<br/>“Even the name sounds deadly,” he says. “I’m sorry, Katniss. I really thought they were the same ones you’d gathered.”<br/>“Don’t apologize. It just means we’re one step closer to home, right?” I ask.<br/>“I’ll get rid of the rest,” Peeta says. He gathers up the sheet of blue plastic, careful to trap the berries inside, and goes to toss them into the woods.<br/>“Wait!” I cry. I find the leather pouch that belonged to the boy from District 1 and fill it with a few handfuls of berries from the plastic. “If they fooled Foxface, maybe they can fool Cato as well.

Nagging him about how loud he was, screaming at him over disappearing. The playful romance we had sustained in the cave has disappeared out in the open, under the hot sun, with the threat of Cato looming over us. Haymitch has probably just about had it with me.

He hasn’t said it, but I don’t think Peeta felt good about killing her, even if it was essential. I can’t pretend I’ll miss her, but I have to admire her. My guess is if they had given us some sort of test, she would have been the smartest of all the tributes. If, in fact, we had been setting a trap for her, I bet she’d have sensed it and avoided the berries. It was Peeta’s own ignorance that brought her down. I’ve spent so much time making sure I don’t underestimate my opponents that I’ve forgotten it’s just as dangerous to overestimate them as well</td>

I give the rocks a pat good-bye and we head down to the stream to wash up. I can feel my skin, itching for the cool water. I may do my hair and braid it back wet. I’m wondering if we might even be able to give our clothes a quick scrub when we reach the stream. Or what used to be the stream. Now there’s only a bone-dry bed. I put my hand down to feel it.<br/>“Not even a little damp. They must have drained it while we slept,” I say. A fear of the cracked tongue, aching body and fuzzy mind brought on by my previous dehydration creeps into my consciousness. Our bottles and skin are fairly full, but with two drinking and this hot sun it won’t take long to deplete them.<br/>“The lake,” says Peeta. “That’s where they want us to go.”<br/>“Maybe the ponds still have some,” I say hopefully.<br/>“We can check,” he says, but he’s just humoring me. I’m humoring myself because I know what I’ll find when we return to the pond where I soaked my leg. A dusty, gaping mouth of a hole. But we make the trip anyway just to confirm what we already know.<br/>“You’re right. They’re driving us to the lake,” I say. Where there’s no cover. Where they’re guaranteed a bloody fight to the death with nothing to block their view. “Do you want to go straightaway or wait until the water’s tapped out?”<br/>“Let’s go now, while we’ve had food and rest.

<td>We sit by the lake, in full sight. There’s no point in hiding now. In the trees at the edge of the plain, I can see the mockingjays flitting about. Bouncing melodies back and forth between them like brightly colored balls. I open my mouth and sing out Rue’s four-note run. I can feel them pause curiously at the sound of my voice, listening for more. I repeat the notes in the silence. First one mockingjay trills the tune back, then another. Then the whole world comes alive with the sound.<br/>“Just like your father,” says Peeta.<br/>My fingers find the pin on my shirt. “That’s Rue’s song,” I say. “I think they remember it.”<br/>The music swells and I recognize the brilliance of it. As the notes overlap, they complement one another, forming a lovely, unearthly harmony. It was this sound then, thanks to Rue, that sent the orchard workers of District 11 home each night.

Each has a thick coat, some with fur that is straight and sleek, others curly, and the colors vary from jet black to what I can only describe as blond. There’s something else about them, something that makes the hair rise up on the back of my neck, but I can’t put my finger on it.<br/>They put their snouts on the horn, sniffing and tasting the metal, scraping paws over the surface and then making high-pitched yipping sounds to one another. This must be how they communicate because the pack backs up as if to make room. Then one of them, a good-size mutt with silky waves of blond fur takes a running start and leaps onto the horn. Its back legs must be incredibly powerful because it lands a mere ten feet below us, its pink lips pulled back in a snarl. For a moment it hangs there, and in that moment I realize what else unsettled me about the mutts. The green eyes glowering at me are unlike any dog or wolf, any canine I’ve ever seen. They are unmistakably human. And that revelation has barely registered when I notice the collar with the number 1<br/> inlaid with jewels and the whole horrible thing hits me.

I want everyone to see,” he says.<br/>I spread out my fingers, and the dark berries glisten in the sun. I give Peeta’s hand one last squeeze as a signal, as a good-bye, and we begin counting. “One.” Maybe I’m wrong. “Two.” Maybe they don’t care if we both die. “Three!” It’s too late to change my mind.

The physical confinement makes me panic and I’m trying to pull myself up and wriggle my hips through the band when a portion of the wall slides open and in steps the redheaded Avox girl carrying a tray. The sight of her calms me and I stop trying to escape. I want to ask her a million questions, but I’m afraid any familiarity would cause her harm. Obviously I am being closely monitored. She sets the tray across my thighs and presses something that raises me to a sitting position. While she adjusts my pillows, I risk one question. I say it out loud, as clearly as my rusty voice will allow, so nothing will seem secretive. “Did Peeta make it?” She gives me a nod, and as she slips a spoon into my hand, I feel the pressure of friendship.<br/>I guess she did not wish me dead after all. And Peeta has made it. Of course, he did. With all their expensive equipment here.

I run for them and surprise even myself when I launch into Haymitch’s arms first. When he whispers in my ear, “Nice job, sweetheart,” it doesn’t sound sarcastic. Effie’s somewhat teary and keeps patting my hair and talking about how she told everyone we were pearls. Cinna just hugs me tight and doesn’t say anything. Then I notice Portia is absent and get a bad feeling.<br/>“Where’s Portia? Is she with Peeta? He is all right, isn’t he? I mean, he’s alive?” I blurt out.<br/>“He’s fine. Only they want to do your reunion live on air at the ceremony,” says Haymitch.<br/>“Oh. That’s all,” I say. The awful moment of thinking Peeta’s dead again passes. “I guess I’d want to see that myself.”<br/></td>

It’s funny, because even though they’re rattling on about the Games, it’s all about where they were or what they were doing or how they felt when a specific event occurred. “I was still in bed!” “I had just had my eyebrows dyed!” “I swear I nearly fainted!” Everything is about them, not the dying boys and girls in the arena.<br/>We don’t wallow around in the Games this way in District 12.

<td>Cinna comes in with what appears to be an unassuming yellow dress across his arms.<br/>“Have you given up the whole ‘girl on fire’ thing?” I ask.<br/>“You tell me,” he says, and slips it over my head. I immediately notice the padding over my breasts, adding curves that hunger has stolen from my body. My hands go to my chest and I frown.<br/>“I know,” says Cinna before I can object. “But the Gamemakers wanted to alter you surgically. Haymitch had a huge fight with them over it. This was the compromise.” He stops me before I can look at my reflection. “Wait, don’t forget the shoes.” Venia helps me into a pair of flat leather sandals and I turn to the mirror.<br/>I am still the “girl on fire.” The sheer fabric softly glows. Even the slight movement in the air sends a ripple up my body. By comparison, the chariot costume seems garish, the interview dress too contrived. In this dress, I give the illusion of wearing candlelight.<br/>“What do you think?” asks Cinna.<br/>“I think it’s the best yet,” I say. When I manage to pull my eyes away from the flickering fabric, I’m in for something of a shock. My hair’s loose, held back by a simple hairband. The makeup rounds and fills out the sharp angles of my face. A clear polish coats my nails. The sleeveless dress is gathered at my ribs, not my waist, largely eliminating any help the padding would have given my figure. The hem falls just to my knees. Without heels, you can see my true stature. I look, very simply, like a girl. A young one. Fourteen at the most. Innocent. Harmless. Yes, it is shocking that Cinna has pulled this off when you remember I’ve just won the Games.<br/>This is a very calculated look. Nothing Cinna designs is arbitrary. I bite my lip trying to figure out his motivation.<br/>“I thought it’d be something more . . . sophisticated-looking,” I say.<br/>“I thought Peeta would like this better,” he answers carefully.<br/>Peeta? No, it’s not about Peeta. It’s about the Capitol and the Gamemakers and the audience. Although I do not yet understand Cinna’s design, it’s a reminder the Games are not quite finished. And beneath his benign reply, I sense a warning. Of something he can’t even mention in front of his own team.<br/>We take the elevator</td>

<td>Easy, just me. Let’s have a look at you,” Haymitch says. I hold out my arms and turn once. “Good enough.”<br/>It’s not much of a compliment. “But what?” I say.<br/>Haymitch’s eyes shift around my musty holding space, and he seems to make a decision. “But nothing. How about a hug for luck?”<br/>Okay, that’s an odd request from Haymitch but, after all, we are victors. Maybe a hug for luck is in order. Only, when I put my arms around his neck, I find myself trapped in his embrace. He begins talking, very fast, very quietly in my ear, my hair concealing his lips.<br/>“Listen up. You’re in trouble. Word is the Capitol’s furious about you showing them up in the arena. The one thing they can’t stand is being laughed at and they’re the joke of Panem,” says Haymitch.<br/>I feel dread coursing through me now, but I laugh as though Haymitch is saying something completely delightful because nothing is covering my mouth. “So, what?”<br/>“Your only defense can be you were so madly in love you weren’t responsible for your actions.” Haymitch pulls back and adjusts my hairband. “Got it, sweetheart?” He could be talking about anything now.</td>

Hopefully, it will be put down to excitement. After all, it’s my night.<br/>The damp, moldy smell beneath the stage threatens to choke me. A cold, clammy sweat breaks out on my skin and I can’t rid myself of the feeling that the boards above my head are about to collapse, to bury me alive under the rubble. When I left the arena, when the trumpets played, I was supposed to be safe. From then on. For the rest of my life. But if what Haymitch says is true, and he’s got no reason to lie, I’ve never been in such a dangerous place in my life.<br/>It’s so much worse than being hunted in the arena. There, I could only die. End of story. But out here Prim, my mother, Gale, the people of District 12, everyone I care about back home could be punished if I can’t pull off the girl-driven-crazy-by-love scenario Haymitch has suggested.<br/>So I still have a chance, though. Funny, in the arena, when I poured out those berries, I was only thinking of outsmarting the Gamemakers, not how my actions would reflect on the Capitol. But the Hunger Games are their weapon and you are not supposed to be able to defeat it. So now the Capitol will act as if they’ve been in control the whole time. As if they orchestrated the whole event, right down to the double suicide. But that will only work if I play along with them.<br/>And Peeta . . . Peeta will suffer, too, if this goes wrong. But what was it Haymitch said when I asked if he had told Peeta the situation? That he had to pretend to be desperately in love?<br/><br/>“Don’t have to. He’s already there.”<br/><br/>Already thinking ahead of me in the Games again and well aware of the danger we’re in? Or . . . already desperately in love? I don’t know.

Then Effie’s introduced. How long she’s waited for this moment.

My heart starts pounding and I have a strong impulse to run. How have the other victors faced this alone? During the highlights, they periodically show the winner’s reaction up on a box in the corner of the screen. I think back to earlier years . . . some are triumphant, pumping their fists in the air, beating their chests. Most just seem stunned. All I know is that the only thing keeping me on this love seat is Peeta — his arm around my shoulder, his other hand claimed by both of mine. Of course, the previous victors didn’t have the Capitol looking for a way to destroy them.</td>

<td>The first half hour or so focuses on the pre-arena events, the reaping, the chariot ride through the Capitol, our training scores, and our interviews. There’s this sort of upbeat soundtrack playing under it that makes it twice as awful because, of course, almost everyone on-screen is dead.<br/>Once we’re in the arena, there’s detailed coverage of the bloodbath and then the filmmakers basically alternate between shots of tributes dying and shots of us. Mostly Peeta really, there’s no question he’s carrying this romance thing on his shoulders. Now I see what the audience saw, how he misled the Careers about me, stayed awake the entire night under the tracker jacker tree, fought Cato to let me escape and even while he lay in that mud bank, whispered my name in his sleep. I seem heartless in comparison — dodging fireballs, dropping nests, and blowing up supplies — until I go hunting for Rue. They play her death in full, the spearing, my failed rescue attempt, my arrow through the boy from District 1’s throat, Rue drawing her last breath in my arms. And the song. I get to sing every note of the song. Something inside me shuts down and I’m too numb to feel anything. It’s like watching complete strangers in another Hunger Games. But I do notice they omit the part where I covered her in flowers.<br/>Right. Because even that smacks of rebellion.<br/>Things pick up for me once they’ve announced two tributes from the same district can live and I shout out Peeta’s name and then clap my hands over my mouth. If I’ve seemed indifferent to him earlier, I make up for it now, by finding him, nursing him back to health, going to the feast for the medicine, and being very free with my kisses. Objectively, I can see the mutts and Cato’s death are as gruesome as ever, but again, I feel it happens to people I have never met.<br/>And then comes the moment with the berries. I can hear the audience hushing one another, not wanting to miss anything. A wave of gratitude to the filmmakers sweeps over me when they end not with the announcement of our victory, but with me pounding on the glass door of the hovercraft, screaming Peeta’s name as they try to revive him.</td>

When Caesar asks Peeta how his “new leg” is working out.<br/>“New leg?” I say, and I can’t help reaching out and pulling up the bottom of Peeta’s pants. “Oh, no,” I whisper, taking in the metal-and-plastic device that has replaced his flesh.<br/>“No one told you?” asks Caesar gently. I shake my head.<br/>“I haven’t had the chance,” says Peeta with a slight shrug.<br/>“It’s my fault,” I say. “Because I used that tourniquet.”<br/>“Yes, it’s your fault I’m alive,” says Peeta.<br/>“He’s right,” says Caesar. “He’d have bled to death for sure without it.”<br/>I guess this is true, but I can’t help feeling upset about it to the extent that I’m afraid I might cry and then I remember everyone in the country is watching me so I just bury my face in Peeta’s shirt. It takes them a couple of minutes to coax me back out because it’s better in the shirt, where no one can see me, and when I do come out, Caesar backs off questioning me so I can recover.

This is the crucial moment where I either challenged the Capitol or went so crazy at the idea of losing Peeta that I can’t be held responsible for my actions. It seems to call for a big, dramatic speech, but all I get out is one almost inaudible sentence. “I don’t know, I just . . . couldn’t bear the thought of . . . being without him.”<br/>“Peeta?

No, forget that. I guess the real question is what’s going to be left when we get home?” he says.<br/>“I don’t know. The closer we get to District Twelve, the more confused I get,” I say.

He gives me a nod, his face expressionless.<br/>I want to tell him that he’s not being fair. That we were strangers. That I did what it took to stay alive, to keep us both alive in the arena. That I can’t explain how things are with Gale because I don’t know myself. That it’s no good loving me because I’m never going to get married anyway and he’d just end up hating me later instead of sooner. That if I do have feelings for him, it doesn’t matter because I’ll never be able to afford the kind of love that leads to a family, to children. And how can he? How can he after what we’ve just been through?<br/>I also want to tell him how much I already miss him. But that wouldn’t be fair on my part.<br/>So we just stand there silently, watching our grimy little station rise up around us. Through the window, I can see the platform’s thick with cameras. Everyone will be eagerly watching our homecoming.<br/>Out of the corner of my eye, I see Peeta extend his hand. I look at him, unsure. “One more time? For the audience?” he says. His voice isn’t angry. It’s hollow, which is worse. Already the boy with the bread is slipping away from me.<br/>I take his hand, holding on tightly, preparing for the cameras, and dreading the moment when I will finally have to let go.</td>

Less than a week after she gave birth, she was out hunting the streets for work. The mines weren’t an option, what with a baby to look after, but she managed to get laundry from some of the merchants in town. At fourteen, Gale, the eldest of the kids, became the main supporter of the family. He was already signed up for tesserae, which entitled them to a meager supply of grain and oil in exchange for his entering his name extra times in the drawing to become a tribute. On top of that, even back then, he was a skilled trapper. But it wasn’t enough to keep a family of five without Hazelle working her fingers to the bone on that washboard. In winter her hands got so red and cracked, they bled at the slightest provocation. Still would if it wasn’t for a salve my mother concocted.

Gale told me that Greasy Sae, the old woman who serves up soup, started a collection to sponsor Peeta and me during the Games. It was supposed to be just a Hob thing, but a lot of other people heard about it and chipped in. I don’t know exactly how much it was, and the price of any gift in the arena was exorbitant. But for all I know, it made the difference between my life and death.<br/>It’s still odd to drag open the front door with an empty game bag, with nothing to trade, and instead feel the heavy pocket of coins against my hip. I try to hit as many stalls as possible, spreading out my purchases of coffee, buns, eggs, yarn, and oil. As an afterthought, I buy three bottles of white liquor from a one-armed woman named Ripper, a victim of a mine accident who was smart enough to find a way to stay alive.<br/>The liquor isn’t for my family. It’s for Haymitch, who acted as mentor for Peeta and me in the Games. He’s surly, violent, and drunk most of the time. But he did his job—more than his job—because for the first time in history, two tributes were allowed to win. So no matter who Haymitch is, I owe him, too. And that’s for always. I’m getting the white liquor because a few weeks ago he ran out and there was none for sale and he had a withdrawal, shaking and screaming at terrifying things only he could see. He scared Prim to death and, frankly, it wasn’t much fun for me to see him like that, either. Ever since then I’ve been sort of stockpiling the stuff just in case there’s a shortage again.<br/></td>

Because sometimes things happen to people and they’re not equipped to deal with them.<br/>Like me, for instance. Right now.<br/>Besides, there’s one wonderful thing she did when I arrived back in the district. After our families and friends had greeted Peeta and me at the train station, there were a few questions allowed from reporters. Someone asked my mother what she thought of my new boyfriend, and she replied that, while Peeta was the very model of what a young man should be, I wasn’t old enough to have any boyfriend at all. She followed this with a pointed look at Peeta. There was a lot of laughter and comments like “Somebody’s in trouble” from the press, and Peeta dropped my hand and sidestepped away from me. That didn’t last long—there was too much pressure to act otherwise—but it gave us an excuse to be a little more reserved than we’d been in the Capitol. And maybe it can help account for how little I’ve been seen in Peeta’s company since the cameras left.</td>

<td>My mother comes in, somewhat shyly, and says that Cinna has asked her to show the preps how she did my hair the day of the reaping. They respond with enthusiasm and then watch, thoroughly engrossed, as she breaks down the process of the elaborate braided hairdo. In the mirror, I can see their earnest faces following her every move, their eagerness when it is their turn to try a step. In fact, all three are so readily respectful and nice to my mother that I feel bad about how I go around feeling so superior to them. Who knows who I would be or what I would talk about if I’d been raised in the Capitol? Maybe my biggest regret would be having feathered costumes at my birthday party, too.</td>

Haymitch tore his out of the wall years ago. My friend Madge, the mayor’s daughter, has a telephone in her house, but if we want to talk, we do it in person. At first, the thing barely ever got used. Then Cinna started to call to work on my talent.<br/>Every victor is supposed to have one. Your talent is the activity you take up since you don’t have to work either in school or your district’s industry. It can be anything, really, anything that they can interview you about</td>

<td>Finally Cinna stepped in and offered to help me develop my passion for designing clothes, which really required development since it was nonexistent. But I said yes because it meant getting to talk to Cinna, and he promised he’d do all the work.<br/>Now he’s arranging things around my living room: clothing, fabrics, and sketchbooks with designs he’s drawn. I pick up one of the sketchbooks and examine a dress I supposedly created. “You know, I think I show a lot of promise,” I say.<br/>“Get dressed, you worthless thing,” he says, tossing a bundle of clothes at me.<br/>I may have no interest in designing clothes but I do love the ones Cinna makes for me. Like these. Flowing black pants made of a thick, warm material. A comfortable white shirt. A sweater woven from green and blue and gray strands of kitten-soft wool. Laced leather boots that don’t pinch my toes.<br/>“Did I design my outfit?” I ask.<br/>“No, you aspire to design your outfit and be like me, your fashion hero,” says Cinna. He hands me a small stack of cards. “You’ll read these off camera while they’re filming the clothes. Try to sound like you care.”<br/>Just then, Effie Trinket arrives in a pumpkin orange wig to remind everyone, “We’re on a schedule!” She kisses me on both cheeks while waving in the camera crew, then orders me into position. Effie’s the only reason we got anywhere on time in the Capitol, so I try to accommodate her. I start bobbing around like a puppet, holding up outfits and saying meaningless things like “Don’t you love it?” The sound team records me reading from my cards in a chirpy voice so they can insert it later, then I’m tossed out of the room so they can film my/Cinna’s designs in peace.<br/></td>

Leather gloves. A bright red scarf. Something furry covers my ears. “You’re bringing earmuffs back in style.”<br/>I hate earmuffs, I think. They make it hard to hear, and since I was blasted deaf in one ear in the arena, I dislike them even more. After I won, the Capitol repaired my ear, but I still find myself testing it.</td>

<td>We slog back to the train in silence. In the hallway outside my door, Haymitch gives my shoulder a pat and says, “You could do a lot worse, you know.” He heads off to his compartment, taking the smell of wine with him.<br/>In my room, I remove my sodden slippers, my wet robe and pajamas. There are more in the drawers but I just crawl between the covers of my bed in my underclothes. I stare into the darkness, thinking about my conversation with Haymitch. Everything he said was true about the Capitol’s expectations, my future with Peeta, even his last comment. Of course, I could do a lot worse than Peeta. That isn’t really the point, though, is it? One of the few freedoms we have in District 12 is the right to marry who we want or not marry at all. And now even that has been taken away from me. I wonder if President Snow will insist we have children. If we do, they’ll have to face the reaping each year. And wouldn’t it be something to see the child of not one but two victors chosen for the arena? Victors’ children have been in the ring before. It always causes a lot of excitement and generates talk about how the odds are not in that family’s favor. But it happens too frequently to just be about odds. Gale’s convinced the Capitol does it on purpose, rigs the drawings to add extra drama. Given all the trouble I’ve caused, I’ve probably guaranteed any child of mine a spot in the Games.<br/>I think of Haymitch, unmarried, no family, blotting out the world with drink. He could have had his choice of any woman in the district. And he chose solitude. Not solitude—that sounds too peaceful. More like solitary confinement. Was it because, having been in the arena, he knew it was better than risking the alternative? I had a taste of that alternative when they called Prim’s name on reaping day and I watched her walk to the stage to her death. But as her sister I could take her place, an option forbidden to our mother.<br/>My mind searches frantically for a way out. I can’t let President Snow condemn me to this. Even if it means taking my own life. Before that, though, I’d try to run away. What would they do if I simply vanished? Disappeared into the woods and never came out? Could I even manage to take everyone I</td>

About the president’s visit, about Gale, about how we’re all going to die if I fail.<br/>His face sobers, grows older in the glow of the red taillights. “Then you can’t fail.”<br/>“If you could just help me get through this trip—” I begin.<br/>“No, Katniss, it’s not just this trip,” he says.<br/>“What do you mean?” I say.<br/>“Even if you pull it off, they’ll be back in another few months to take us all to the Games. You and Peeta, you’ll be mentors now, every year from here on out. And every year they’ll revisit the romance and broadcast the details of your private life, and you’ll never, ever be able to do anything but live happily ever after with that boy.”<br/>The full impact of what he’s saying hits me. I will never have a life with Gale, even if I want to. I will never be allowed to live alone. I will have to be forever in love with Peeta. The Capitol will insist on it. I’ll have a few years maybe, because I’m still only sixteen, to stay with my mother and Prim. And then…and then…<br/>“Do you understand what I mean?” he presses me.<br/>I nod. He means there’s only one future, if I want to keep those I love alive and stay alive myself. I’ll have to marry Peeta.</td>

<td>The train suddenly seems stifling and I’m definitely queasy now. I find the exit door, force it open—triggering some sort of alarm, which I ignore—and jump to the ground, expecting to land in snow. But the air’s warm and balmy against my skin. The trees still wear green leaves. How far south have we come in a day? I walk along the track, squinting against the bright sunlight, already regretting my words to Effie. She’s hardly to blame for my current predicament. I should go back and apologize. My outburst was the height of bad manners, and manners matter deeply to her. But my feet continue on along the track, past the end of the train, leaving it behind. An hour’s delay. I can walk at least twenty minutes in one direction and make it back with plenty of time to spare. Instead, after a couple hundred yards, I sink to the ground and sit there, looking into the distance. If I had a bow and arrows, would I just keep going?<br/>After a while I hear footsteps behind me. It’ll be Haymitch, coming to chew me out. It’s not like I don’t deserve it, but I still don’t want to hear it. “I’m not in the mood for a lecture,” I warn the clump of weeds by my shoes.<br/>“I’ll try to keep it brief.” Peeta takes a seat beside me.<br/>“I thought you were Haymitch,” I say.<br/>“No, he’s still working on that muffin.” I watch as Peeta positions his artificial leg. “Bad day, huh?”<br/>“It’s nothing,” I say.<br/>He takes a deep breath. “Look, Katniss, I’ve been wanting to talk to you about the way I acted on the train. I mean, the last train. The one that brought us home. I knew you had something with Gale. I was jealous of him before I even officially met you. And it wasn’t fair to hold you to anything that happened in the Games. I’m sorry.”<br/>His apology takes me by surprise. It’s true that Peeta froze me out after I confessed that my love for him during the Games was something of an act. But I don’t hold that against him. In the arena, I’d played that romance angle for all it was worth. There had been times when I didn’t honestly know how I felt about him. I still don’t, really.<br/>“I’m sorry, too,” I say. I’m not sure for what exactly. Maybe because there’s a real chance I’m about to destroy him.<br/>“There’s nothing for you to be sorry about. You were just keeping us alive. But I don’t want us to go on like this, ignoring each other in real life and falling into the snow every time there’s a camera around. So I thought if I stopped being so, you know, wounded, we could take a shot at just being friends,” he says.<br/>All my friends are probably going to end up dead, but refusing Peeta wouldn’t keep him safe. “Okay,” I say. His offer does make me feel better. Less duplicitous somehow. It would be nice if he’d come to me with this earlier, before I knew that President Snow had other plans and just being friends was not an option for us anymore. But either way, I’m glad we’re speaking again.<br/>“So what’s wrong?” he asks.</td>

<td>Peeta had his personal comments written on a card, but he doesn’t pull it out. Instead he speaks in his simple, winning style about Thresh and Rue making it to the final eight, about how they both kept me alive—thereby keeping him alive—and about how this is a debt we can never repay. And then he hesitates before adding something that wasn’t written on the card. Maybe because he thought Effie might make him remove it. “It can in no way replace your losses, but as a token of our thanks we’d like for each of the tributes’ families from District Eleven to receive one month of our winnings every year for the duration of our lives.”<br/>The crowd can’t help but respond with gasps and murmurs. There is no precedent for what Peeta has done. I don’t even know if it’s legal. He probably doesn’t know, either, so he didn’t ask in case it isn’t. As for the families, they just stare at us in shock. Their lives were changed forever when Thresh and Rue were lost, but this gift will change them again. A month of tribute winnings can easily provide for a family for a year. As long as we live, they will not hunger.<br/>I look at Peeta and he gives me a sad smile. I hear Haymitch’s voice. “You could do a lot worse.” At this moment, it’s impossible to imagine how I could do any better. The gift…it is perfect. So when I rise up on tiptoe to kiss him, it doesn’t seem forced at all.</td>

<td>The ceremony’s about to end when I notice one of Rue’s sisters staring at me. She must be about nine and is almost an exact replica of Rue, down to the way she stands with her arms slightly extended. Despite the good news about the winnings, she’s not happy. In fact, her look is reproachful. Is it because I didn’t save Rue?<br/>No. It’s because I still haven’t thanked her, I think.<br/>A wave of shame rushes through me. The girl is right. How can I stand here, passive and mute, leaving all the words to Peeta? If she had won, Rue would never have let my death go unsung. I remember how I took care in the arena to cover her with flowers, to make sure her loss did not go unnoticed. But that gesture will mean nothing if I don’t support it now.<br/>“Wait!” I stumble forward, pressing the plaque to my chest. My allotted time for speaking has come and gone, but I must say something. I owe too much. And even if I had pledged all my winnings to the families, it would not excuse my silence today. “Wait, please.” I don’t know how to start, but once I do, the words rush from my lips as if they’ve been forming in the back of my mind for a long time.<br/>“I want to give my thanks to the tributes of District Eleven,” I say. I look at the pair of women on Thresh’s side. “I only ever spoke to Thresh one time. Just long enough for him to spare my life. I didn’t know him, but I always respected him. For his power. For his refusal to play the Games on anyone’s terms but his own. The Careers wanted him to team up with them from the beginning, but he wouldn’t do it. I respected him for that.”<br/>For the first time the old hunched woman—is she Thresh’s grandmother?—raises her head and the trace of a smile plays on her lips.<br/>The crowd has fallen silent now, so silent that I wonder how they manage it. They must all be holding their breath.<br/>I turn to Rue’s family. “But I feel as if I did know Rue, and she’ll always be with me. Everything beautiful brings her to mind. I see her in the yellow flowers that grow in the Meadow by my house. I see her in the mockingjays that sing in the trees. But most of all, I see her in my sister, Prim.” My voice is undependable, but I am almost finished. “Thank you for your children.” I raise my chin to address the crowd. “And thank you all for the bread.”<br/></td>

<td>We ascend a magnificent curved marble staircase. At the top, there’s a long hall with worn carpet on the floor. Double doors stand open, welcoming us into the first room we encounter. The ceiling must be twenty feet high. Designs of fruit and flowers are carved into the molding and small, fat children with wings look down at us from every angle. Vases of blossoms give off a cloying scent that makes my eyes itch. Our evening clothes hang on racks against the wall. This room has been prepared for our use, but we’re barely there long enough to drop off our gifts. Then Haymitch yanks the microphones from our chests, stuffs them beneath a couch cushion, and waves us on.<br/>As far as I know, Haymitch has only been here once, when he was on his Victory Tour decades ago. But he must have a remarkable memory or reliable instincts, because he leads us up through a maze of twisting staircases and increasingly narrow halls. At times he has to stop and force a door. By the protesting squeak of the hinges you can tell it’s been a long time since it was opened. Eventually we climb a ladder to a trapdoor. When Haymitch pushes it aside, we find ourselves in the dome of the Justice Building. It’s a huge place filled with broken furniture, piles of books and ledgers, and rusty weapons. The coat of dust blanketing everything is so thick it’s clear it hasn’t been disturbed for years. Light struggles to filter in through four grimy square windows set in the sides of the dome. Haymitch kicks the trapdoor shut and turns on us.<br/>“What happened?” he asks.<br/>Peeta relates all that occurred in the square. The whistle, the salute, our hesitation on the verandah, the murder of the old man. “What’s going on, Haymitch?”<br/>“It will be better coming from you,” Haymitch says to me.<br/>I don’t agree. I think it will be a hundred times worse coming from me. But I tell Peeta everything as calmly as I can. About President Snow, the unrest in the districts. I don’t even omit the kiss with Gale. I lay out how we are all in jeopardy, how the whole country is in jeopardy because of my trick with the berries. “I was supposed to fix things on this tour. Make everyone who had doubted believe I acted out of love. Calm things down. But obviously, all I’ve done today is get three people killed, and now everyone in the square will be punished.” I feel so sick that I have to sit down on a couch, despite the exposed springs and stuffing.<br/>“Then I made things worse, too. By giving the money,” says Peeta. Suddenly he strikes out at a lamp that sits precariously on a crate and knocks it across the room, where it shatters against the floor. “This has to stop. Right now. This—this—game you two play, where you tell each other secrets but keep them from me like I’m too inconsequential or stupid or weak to handle them.”<br/>“It’s not like that, Peeta—” I begin.<br/>“It’s exactly like that!” he yells at me. “I have people I care about, too, Katniss! Family and friends back in District Twelve who will be just as dead as yours if we don’t pull this thing off. So, after all we went through in the arena, don’t I even rate the truth from you?”<br/></td>

<td>You’re always so reliably good, Peeta,” says Haymitch. “So smart about how you present yourself before the cameras. I didn’t want to disrupt that.”<br/>“Well, you overestimated me. Because I really screwed up today. What do you think is going to happen to Rue’s and Thresh’s families? Do you think they’ll get their share of our winnings? Do you think I gave them a bright future? Because I think they’ll be lucky if they survive the day!” Peeta sends something else flying, a statue. I’ve never seen him like this.<br/>“He’s right, Haymitch,” I say. “We were wrong not to tell him. Even back in the Capitol.”<br/>“Even in the arena, you two had some sort of system worked out, didn’t you?” asks Peeta. His voice is quieter now. “Something I wasn’t part of.”<br/>“No. Not officially. I just could tell what Haymitch wanted me to do by what he sent, or didn’t send,” I say.<br/>“Well, I never had that opportunity. Because he never sent me anything until you showed up,” says Peeta.<br/>I haven’t thought much about this. How it must have looked from Peeta’s perspective when I appeared in the arena having received burn medicine and bread when he, who was at death’s door, had gotten nothing. Like Haymitch was keeping me alive at his expense.<br/>“Look, boy—” Haymitch begins.<br/>“Don’t bother, Haymitch. I know you had to choose one of us. And I’d have wanted it to be her. But this is something different. People are dead out there. More will follow unless we’re very good. We all know I’m better than Katniss in front of the cameras. No one needs to coach me on what to say. But I have to know what I’m walking into,” says Peeta.<br/>“From now on, you’ll be fully informed,” Haymitch promises.<br/>“I better be,” says Peeta. He doesn’t even bother to look at me before he leaves.<br/>The dust he disrupted billows up and looks for new places to land. My hair, my eyes, my shiny gold pin.<br/>“Did you choose me, Haymitch?” I ask.<br/>“Yeah,” he says.<br/>“Why? You like him better,” I say.<br/>“That’s true. But remember, until they changed the rules, I could only hope to get one of you out of there alive,” he says. “I thought since he was determined to protect you, well, between the three of us, we might be able to bring you home.”<br/>“Oh” is all I can think to say.<br/>“You’ll see, the choices you’ll have to make. If we survive this,” says Haymitch. “You’ll learn.”<br/>Well, I’ve learned one thing today. This place is not a larger version of District 12. Our fence is unguarded and rarely charged. Our Peacekeepers are unwelcome but less brutal. Our hardships evoke more fatigue than fury. Here in 11, they suffer more acutely and feel more desperation. President Snow is right.

<td>When we all assemble to go down to the dinner, I can see Effie is out of sorts. Surely, Haymitch hasn’t told her about what happened in the square. I wouldn’t be surprised if Cinna and Portia know, but there seems to be an unspoken agreement to leave Effie out of the bad-news loop. It doesn’t take long to hear about the problem, though.<br/>Effie runs through the evening’s schedule, then tosses it aside. “And then, thank goodness, we can all get on that train and get out of here,” she says.<br/>“Is something wrong, Effie?” asks Cinna.<br/>“I don’t like the way we’ve been treated. Being stuffed into trucks and barred from the platform. And then, about an hour ago, I decided to look around the Justice Building.

One of them actually poked me with her gun!” says Effie.<br/>I can’t help thinking this is the direct result of Haymitch, Peeta, and me disappearing earlier in the day. It’s a little reassuring, actually, to think that Haymitch might have been right. That no one would have been monitoring the dusty dome where we talked. Although I bet they are now.<br/>Effie looks so distressed that I spontaneously give her a hug. “That’s awful, Effie. Maybe we shouldn’t go to the dinner at all. At least until they’ve apologized.” I know she’ll never agree to this, but she brightens considerably at the suggestion, at the validation of her complaint.<br/>“No, I’ll manage.

I can’t guess what form my punishment will take, how wide the net will be cast, but when it is finished, there will most likely be nothing left. So you would think that at this moment, I would be in utter despair. Here’s what’s strange. The main thing I feel is a sense of relief. That I can give up this game.

That if desperate times call for desperate measures, then I am free to act as desperately as I wish.<br/>Only not here, not quite yet.

They lead us over to a table that holds tiny stemmed wineglasses filled with clear liquid. “Drink this!”<br/>Peeta picks one up to take a sip and they lose it.<br/>“Not here!” shrieks Octavia.<br/>“You have to do it in there,” says Venia, pointing to doors that lead to the toilets. “Or you’ll get it all over the floor!”<br/>Peeta looks at the glass again and puts it together. “You mean this will make me puke?”<br/>My prep team laughs hysterically. “Of course, so you can keep eating,” says Octavia. “I’ve been in there twice already. Everyone does it, or else how would you have any fun at a feast?”<br/>I’m speechless, staring at the pretty little glasses and all they imply. Peeta sets his back on the table with such precision you’d think it might detonate. “Come on, Katniss, let’s dance.”<br/></td>

<td>Music filters down from the clouds as he leads me away from the team, the table, and out onto the floor. We know only a few dances at home, the kind that go with fiddle and flute music and require a good deal of space. But Effie has shown us some that are popular in the Capitol. The music’s slow and dreamlike, so Peeta pulls me into his arms and we move in a circle with practically no steps at all. You could do this dance on a pie plate. We’re quiet for a while. Then Peeta speaks in a strained voice.<br/>“You go along, thinking you can deal with it, thinking maybe they’re not so bad, and then you—” He cuts himself off.<br/>All I can think of is the emaciated bodies of the children on our kitchen table as my mother prescribes what the parents can’t give. More food. Now that we’re rich, she’ll send some home with them. But often in the old days, there was nothing to give and the child was past saving, anyway. And here in the Capitol they’re vomiting for the pleasure of filling their bellies again and again. Not from some illness of body or mind, not from spoiled food. It’s what everyone does at a party. Expected. Part of the fun.<br/>One day when I dropped by to give Hazelle the game, Vick was home sick with a bad cough. Being part of Gale’s family, the kid has to eat better than ninety percent of the rest of District 12. But he still spent about fifteen minutes talking about how they’d opened a can of corn syrup from Parcel Day and each had a spoonful on bread and were going to maybe have more later in the week. How Hazelle had said he could have a bit in a cup of tea to soothe his cough, but he wouldn’t feel right unless the others had some, too. If it’s like that at Gale’s, what’s it like in the other houses?<br/>“Peeta, they bring us here to fight to the death for their entertainment,” I say. “Really, this is nothing by comparison.”<br/>“I know. I know that. It’s just sometimes I can’t stand it anymore. To the point where…I’m not sure what I’ll do.” He pauses, then whispers, “Maybe we were wrong, Katniss.”<br/>“About what?” I ask.<br/>“About trying to subdue things in the districts,” he says.</td>

<td>Just then Portia appears with a large man who looks vaguely familiar. She introduces him as Plutarch Heavensbee, the new Head Gamemaker. Plutarch asks Peeta if he can steal me for a dance. Peeta’s recovered his camera face and good-naturedly passes me over, warning the man not to get too attached.<br/>I don’t want to dance with Plutarch Heavensbee. I don’t want to feel his hands, one resting against mine, one on my hip. I’m not used to being touched, except by Peeta or my family, and I rank Gamemakers somewhere below maggots in terms of creatures I want in contact with my skin. But he seems to sense this and holds me almost at arm’s length as we turn on the floor.<br/>We chitchat about the party, about the entertainment, about the food, and then he makes a joke about avoiding punch since training. I don’t get it, and then I realize he’s the man who tripped backward into the punch bowl when I shot an arrow at the Gamemakers during the training session. Well, not really. I was shooting an apple out of their roast pig’s mouth. But I made them jump.<br/>“Oh, you’re one who—” I laugh, remembering him splashing back into the punch bowl.<br/>“Yes. And you’ll be pleased to know I’ve never recovered,” says Plutarch.<br/>I want to point out that twenty-two dead tributes will never recover from the Games he helped create, either. But I only say, “Good. So, you’re the Head Gamemaker this year? That must be a big honor.”<br/>“Between you and me, there weren’t many takers for the job,” he says. “So much responsibility as to how the Games turn out.”<br/>Yeah, the last guy’s dead, I think. He must know about Seneca Crane, but he doesn’t look the least bit concerned. “Are you planning the Quarter Quell Games already?” I say.<br/>“Oh, yes. Well, they’ve been in the works for years, of course. Arenas aren’t built in a day. But the, shall we say, flavor of the Games is being determined now. Believe it or not, I’ve got a strategy meeting tonight,” he says.<br/>Plutarch steps back and pulls out a gold watch on a chain from a vest pocket. He flips open the lid, sees the time, and frowns. “I’ll have to be going soon.” He turns the watch so I can see the face. “It starts at midnight.”<br/>“That seems late for—” I say, but then something distracts me. Plutarch has run his thumb across the crystal face of the watch and for just a moment an image appears, glowing as if lit by candlelight. It’s another mockingjay. Exactly like the pin on my dress. Only this one disappears. He snaps the watch closed.<br/>“That’s very pretty,” I say.<br/>“Oh, it’s more than pretty. It’s one of a kind,” he says. “If anyone asks about me, say I’ve gone home to bed. The meetings are supposed to be kept secret. But I thought it’d be safe to tell you.”<br/>“Yes. Your secret’s safe with me,” I say.<br/>As we shake hands, he gives a small bow, a common gesture here in the Capitol. “Well, I’ll see you next summer at the Games, Katniss. Best wishes on your engagement, and good luck with your mother.”<br/>“I’ll need it,” I say.<br/>Plutarch disappears and I wander through the crowd, looking for Peeta, as strangers congratulate me. On my engagement, on my victory at the Games, on my choice of lipstick. I respond, but really I’m thinking about Plutarch showing off his pretty, one-of-a-kind watch to me. There was something strange about it. Almost clandestine. But why? Maybe he thinks someone else will steal his idea of putting a disappearing mockingjay on a watch face. Yes, he probably paid a fortune for it and now he can’t show it to anyone because he’s afraid someone will make a cheap, knockoff version. Only in the Capitol.</td>

<td>When I open my eyes, it’s early afternoon. My head rests on Peeta’s arm. I don’t remember him coming in last night. I turn, being careful not to disturb him, but he’s already awake.<br/>“No nightmares,” he says.<br/>“What?” I ask.<br/>“You didn’t have any nightmares last night,” he says.<br/>He’s right. For the first time in ages I’ve slept through the night. “I had a dream, though,” I say, thinking back. “I was following a mockingjay through the woods. For a long time. It was Rue, really. I mean, when it sang, it had her voice.”<br/>“Where did she take you?” he says, brushing my hair off my forehead.<br/>“I don’t know. We never arrived,” I say. “But I felt happy.”<br/>“Well, you slept like you were happy,” he says.<br/>“Peeta, how come I never know when you’re having a nightmare?” I say.<br/>“I don’t know. I don’t think I cry out or thrash around or anything. I just come to, paralyzed with terror,” he says.<br/>“You should wake me,” I say, thinking about how I can interrupt his sleep two or three times on a bad night. About how long it can take to calm me down.<br/>“It’s not necessary. My nightmares are usually about losing you,” he says. “I’m okay once I realize you’re here.”<br/>Ugh. Peeta makes comments like this in such an offhand way, and it’s like being hit in the gut. He’s only answering my question honestly. He’s not pressing me to reply in kind, to make any declaration of love. But I still feel awful, as if I’ve been using him in some terrible way. Have I? I don’t know. I only know that for the first time, I feel immoral about him being here in my bed. Which is ironic since we’re officially engaged now.<br/>“Be worse when we’re home and I’m sleeping alone again,” he says.<br/>That’s right, we’re almost home.</td>

I could take hours trying to explain, and even then have him refuse me. Instead I go straight to the heart of my defense.<br/>“President Snow personally threatened to have you killed,” I say.<br/>Gale raises his eyebrows slightly, but there’s no real show of fear or astonishment. “Anyone else?”<br/>“Well, he didn’t actually give me a copy of the list. But it’s a good guess it includes both our families,” I say.<br/>It’s enough to bring him to the fire. He crouches before the hearth and warms himself. “Unless what?”<br/>“Unless nothing, now,” I say. Obviously this requires more of an explanation, but I have no idea where to start, so I just sit there staring gloomily into the fire.<br/>After about a minute of this, Gale breaks the silence. “Well, thanks for the heads-up.”<br/>I turn to him, ready to snap, but I catch the glint in his eye. I hate myself for smiling. This is not a funny moment, but I guess it’s a lot to drop on someone. We’re all going to be obliterated no matter what. “I do have a plan, you know.”<br/>“Yeah, I bet</td>

<td>Katniss,” Peeta says. I don’t slow down. If he thinks it’s a bad idea, I don’t want to know, because it’s the only one I have. “Katniss, hold up.” I kick a dirty, frozen chunk of snow off the path and let him catch up. The coal dust makes everything look especially ugly. “I really will go, if you want me to. I just think we better talk it through with Haymitch. Make sure we won’t be making things worse for everyone.” He raises his head. “What’s that?”<br/>I lift my chin. I’ve been so consumed with my own worries, I haven’t noticed the strange noise coming from the square. A whistling, the sound of an impact, the intake of breath from a crowd.<br/>“Come on,” Peeta says, his face suddenly hard. I don’t know why. I can’t place the sound, even guess at the situation. But it means something bad to him.<br/>When we reach the square, it’s clear something’s happening, but the crowd’s too thick to see. Peeta steps up on a crate against the wall of the sweetshop and offers me a hand while he scans the square. I’m halfway up when he suddenly blocks my way. “Get down. Get out of here!” He’s whispering, but his voice is harsh with insistence.<br/>“What?” I say, trying to force my way back up.<br/>“Go home, Katniss! I’ll be there in a minute, I swear!” he says.<br/>Whatever it is, it’s terrible. I yank away from his hand and begin to push my way through the crowd. People see me, recognize my face, and then look panicked. Hands shove me back. Voices hiss.<br/>“Get out of here, girl.”<br/>“Only make it worse.”<br/>“What do you want to do? Get him killed?”<br/>But at this point, my heart is beating so fast and fierce I hardly hear them. I only know that whatever waits in the middle of the square is meant for me. When I finally break through to the cleared space, I see I am right. And Peeta was right. And those voices were right, too.<br/>Gale’s wrists are bound to a wooden post. The wild turkey he shot earlier hangs above him, the nail driven through its neck. His jacket’s been cast aside on the ground, his shirt torn away. He slumps unconscious on his knees, held up only by the ropes at his wrists. What used to be his back is a raw, bloody slab of meat.<br/>Standing behind him is a man I’ve never seen, but I recognize his uniform. It’s the one designated for our Head Peacekeeper. This isn’t old Cray, though. This is a tall, muscular man with sharp creases in his pants.<br/>The pieces of the picture do not quite come together until I see his arm raise the whip.</td>

<td>“No!” I cry, and spring forward. It’s too late to stop the arm from descending, and I instinctively know I won’t have the power to block it. Instead I throw myself directly between the whip and Gale. I’ve flung out my arms to protect as much of his broken body as possible, so there’s nothing to deflect the lash. I take the full force of it across the left side of my face.<br/>The pain is blinding and instantaneous. Jagged flashes of light cross my vision and I fall to my knees. One hand cups my cheek while the other keeps me from tipping over. I can already feel the welt rising up, the swelling closing my eye. The stones beneath me are wet with Gale’s blood, the air heavy with its scent. “Stop it! You’ll kill him!” I shriek.<br/>I get a glimpse of my assailant’s face. Hard, with deep lines, a cruel mouth. Gray hair shaved almost to nonexistence, eyes so black they seem all pupils, a long, straight nose reddened by the freezing air. The powerful arm lifts again, his sights set on me. My hand flies to my shoulder, hungry for an arrow, but, of course, my weapons are stashed in the woods. I grit my teeth in anticipation of the next lash.<br/>“Hold it!” a voice barks. Haymitch appears and trips over a Peacekeeper lying on the ground. It’s Darius. A huge purple lump pushes through the red hair on his forehead. He’s knocked out but still breathing. What happened? Did he try to come to Gale’s aid before I got here?<br/>Haymitch ignores him and pulls me to my feet roughly. “Oh, excellent.” His hand locks under my chin, lifting it. “She’s got a photo shoot next week modeling wedding dresses. What am I supposed to tell her stylist?”<br/>I see a flicker of recognition in the eyes of the man with the whip. Bundled against the cold, my face free of makeup, my braid tucked carelessly under my coat, it wouldn’t be easy to identify me as the victor of the last Hunger Games. Especially with half my face swelling up. But Haymitch has been showing up on television for years, and he’d be difficult to forget.<br/>The man rests the whip on his hip. “She interrupted the punishment of a confessed criminal.”<br/>Everything about this man, his commanding voice, his odd accent, warns of an unknown and dangerous threat. Where has he come from? District 11? 3? From the Capitol itself?<br/>“I don’t care if she blew up the blasted Justice Building! Look at her cheek! Think that will be camera ready in a week?” Haymitch snarls.<br/>The man’s voice is still cold, but I can detect a slight edge of doubt. “That’s not my problem.”<br/>“No? Well, it’s about to be, my friend. The first call I make when I get home is to the Capitol,” says Haymitch. “Find out who authorized you to mess up my victor’s pretty little face!”<br/>“He was poaching. What business is it of hers, anyway?” says the man.<br/>“He’s her cousin.” Peeta’s got my other arm now, but gently. “And she’s my fiancée. So if you want to get to him, expect to go through both of us.”<br/>Maybe we’re it. The only three people in the district who could make a stand like this. Although it’s sure to be temporary. There will be repercussions. But at the moment, all I care about is keeping Gale alive. The new Head Peacekeeper glances over at his backup squad. With relief, I see they’re familiar faces, old friends from the Hob. You can tell by their expressions that they’re not enjoying the show.<br/></td>

Unless your sentence is death, which we would carry out by firing squad.”<br/>“Is that the standard protocol here?” asks the Head Peacekeeper.<br/>“Yes, sir,” Purnia says, and several others nod in agreement.

But after what just happened, I can’t blame anyone.<br/>By the time we’ve laid Gale facedown on the board, there’s only a handful of people left to carry him.

<td>Snow begins, thick and wet, making visibility even more difficult. I stumble up the walk to my house behind the others, using my ears more than my eyes to guide me. A golden light colors the snow as the door opens. My mother, who was no doubt waiting for me after a long day of unexplained absence, takes in the scene.<br/>“New Head,” Haymitch says, and she gives him a curt nod as if no other explanation is needed.<br/>I’m filled with awe, as I always am, as I watch her transform from a woman who calls me to kill a spider to a woman immune to fear. When a sick or dying person is brought to her…this is the only time I think my mother knows who she is. In moments, the long kitchen table has been cleared, a sterile white cloth spread across it, and Gale hoisted onto it. My mother pours water from a kettle into a basin while ordering Prim to pull a series of her remedies from the medicine cabinet. Dried herbs and tinctures and store-bought bottles. I watch her hands, the long, tapered fingers crumbling this, adding drops of that, into the basin. Soaking a cloth in the hot liquid as she gives Prim instructions to prepare a second brew.<br/>My mother glances my way. “Did it cut your eye?”<br/>“No, it’s just swelled shut,” I say.<br/>“Get more snow on it,” she instructs. But I am clearly not a priority.<br/>“Can you save him?” I ask my mother. She says nothing as she wrings out the cloth and holds it in the air to cool somewhat.</td>

<td>Even in her expert hands, it takes a long time to clean the wounds, arrange what shredded skin can be saved, apply a salve and a light bandage. As the blood clears, I can see where every stroke of the lash landed and feel it resonate in the single cut on my face. I multiply my own pain once, twice, forty times and can only hope that Gale remains unconscious. Of course, that’s too much to ask for. As the final bandages are being placed, a moan escapes his lips. Hazelle strokes his hair and whispers something while my mother and Prim go through their meager store of painkillers, the kind usually accessible only to doctors. They are hard to come by, expensive, and always in demand. My mother has to save the strongest for the worst pain, but what is the worst pain? To me, it’s always the pain that is present. If I were in charge, those painkillers would be gone in a day because I have so little ability to watch suffering. My mother tries to save them for those who are actually in the process of dying, to ease them out of the world.<br/>Since Gale is regaining consciousness, they decide on an herbal concoction he can take by mouth. “That won’t be enough,” I say. They stare at me. “That won’t be enough, I know how it feels. That will barely knock out a headache.”<br/>“We’ll combine it with sleep syrup, Katniss, and he’ll manage it. The herbs are more for the inflammation—” my mother begins calmly.<br/>“Just give him the medicine!” I scream at her. “Give it to him! Who are you, anyway, to decide how much pain he can stand!”<br/>Gale begins stirring at my voice, trying to reach me. The movement causes fresh blood to stain his bandages and an agonized sound to come from his mouth.<br/>“Take her out,” says my mother.

Had I been older when my father died, I might have been among them.

<td>For the first time, I reverse our positions in my head. I imagine watching Gale volunteering to save Rory in the reaping, having him torn from my life, becoming some strange girl’s lover to stay alive, and then coming home with her. Living next to her. Promising to marry her.<br/>The hatred I feel for him, for the phantom girl, for everything, is so real and immediate that it chokes me. Gale is mine. I am his. Anything else is unthinkable. Why did it take him being whipped within an inch of his life to see it?<br/>Because I’m selfish. I’m a coward. I’m the kind of girl who, when she might actually be of use, would run to stay alive and leave those who couldn’t follow to suffer and die. This is the girl Gale met in the woods today.<br/>No wonder I won the Games. No decent person ever does.<br/>You saved Peeta, I think weakly.<br/>But now I question even that. I knew good and well that my life back in District 12 would be unlivable if I let that boy die.<br/>I rest my head forward on the edge of the table, overcome with loathing for myself. Wishing I had died in the arena. Wishing Seneca Crane had blown me to bits the way President Snow said he should have when I held out the berries.<br/>The berries. I realize the answer to who I am lies in that handful of poisonous fruit. If I held them out to save Peeta because I knew I would be shunned if I came back without him, then I am despicable. If I held them out because I loved him, I am still self-centered, although forgivable. But if I held them out to defy the Capitol, I am someone of worth. The trouble is, I don’t know exactly what was going on inside me at that moment.<br/>Could it be the people in the districts are right? That it was an act of rebellion, even if it was an unconscious one? Because, deep down, I must know it isn’t enough to keep myself, or my family, or my friends alive by running away. Even if I could. It wouldn’t fix anything. It wouldn’t stop people from being hurt the way Gale was today.<br/>Life in District 12 isn’t really so different from life in the arena. At some point, you have to stop running and turn around and face whoever wants you dead. The hard thing is finding the courage to do it. Well, it’s not hard for Gale. He was born a rebel. I’m the one making an escape plan.</td>

<td>Before I go down to face this new life, though, I take some time making myself acknowledge what it will mean. Less than a day ago, I was prepared to head into the wilderness with my loved ones in midwinter, with the very real possibility of the Capitol pursuing us. A precarious venture at best. But now I am committing to something even more risky. Fighting the Capitol assures their swift retaliation. I must accept that at any moment I can be arrested. There will be a knock on the door, like the one last night, a band of Peacekeepers to haul me away. There might be torture. Mutilation. A bullet through my skull in the town square, if I’m fortunate enough to go that quickly. The Capitol has no end of creative ways to kill people. I imagine these things and I’m terrified, but let’s face it: They’ve been lurking in the back of my brain, anyway. I’ve been a tribute in the Games. Been threatened by the president. Taken a lash across my face. I’m already a target.<br/>Now comes the harder part. I have to face the fact that my family and friends might share this fate. Prim. I need only to think of Prim and all my resolve disintegrates. It’s my job to protect her. I pull the blanket up over my head, and my breathing is so rapid I use up all the oxygen and begin to choke for air. I can’t let the Capitol hurt Prim.<br/>And then it hits me. They already have. They have killed her father in those wretched mines. They have sat by as she almost starved to death. They have chosen her as a tribute, then made her watch her sister fight to the death in the Games. She has been hurt far worse than I had at the age of twelve. And even that pales in comparison with Rue’s life.</td>

<td>Prim comes over, stirring what appears to be a large bowl of snow. But it’s tinted a light green and gives off a sweet, clean scent. Snow coat. She carefully begins to ladle the stuff onto the cloth. I can almost hear the sizzle of Gale’s tormented skin meeting the snow mixture. His eyes flutter open, perplexed, and then he lets out a sound of relief.<br/>“It’s lucky we have snow,” says my mother.<br/>I think of what it must be like to recover from a whipping in midsummer, with the searing heat and the tepid water from the tap. “What did you do in warm months?” I ask.<br/>A crease appears between my mother’s eyebrows as she frowns. “Tried to keep the flies away.”<br/></td>

It’s the coldness of the snow, yes, but whatever mix of herbal juices my mother has added numbs as well. “Oh. That’s wonderful. Why didn’t you put this on him last night?”<br/>“I needed the wound to set first,” she says.<br/>I don’t know what that means exactly, but as long as it works, who am I to question her? She knows what she’s doing, my mother. I feel a pang of remorse about yesterday, the awful things I yelled at her as Peeta and Haymitch dragged me from the kitchen. “I’m sorry. About screaming at you yesterday.”<br/>“I’ve heard worse,” she says. “You’ve seen how people are, when someone they love is in pain.”<br/></td>

<td>Nothing much will happen during the blizzard. That’s what Peeta and I had agreed. But we couldn’t have been more wrong. The square has been transformed. A huge banner with the seal of Panem hangs off the roof of the Justice Building. Peacekeepers, in pristine white uniforms, march on the cleanly swept cobblestones. Along the rooftops, more of them occupy nests of machine guns. Most unnerving is a line of new constructions—an official whipping post, several stockades, and a gallows—set up in the center of the square.<br/>“Thread’s a quick worker,” says Haymitch.<br/>Some streets away from the square, I see a blaze flare up. None of us has to say it. That can only be the Hob going up in smoke. I think of Greasy Sae, Ripper, all my friends who make their living there.<br/>“Haymitch, you don’t think everyone was still in—” I can’t finish the sentence.<br/>“Nah, they’re smarter than that. You’d be, too, if you’d been around longer,” he says. “Well, I better go see how much rubbing alcohol the apothecary can spare.”<br/>He trudges off across the square and I look at Peeta. “What’s he want that for?” Then I realize the answer. “We can’t let him drink it. He’ll kill himself, or at the very least go blind. I’ve got some white liquor put away at home.”<br/>“Me, too. Maybe that will hold him until Ripper finds a way to be back in business,” says Peeta. “I need to check on my family.”<br/>“I have to go see Hazelle.” I’m worried now. I thought</td>

<td>No one mentions the ugly tools of torture just yards from the front door. The last thing I notice as we leave the square is that I do not recognize even one of the Peacekeepers’ faces.<br/>As the days pass, things go from bad to worse. The mines stay shut for two weeks, and by that time half of District 12 is starving. The number of kids signing up for tesserae soars, but they often don’t receive their grain. Food shortages begin, and even those with money come away from stores empty-handed. When the mines reopen, wages are cut, hours extended, miners sent into blatantly dangerous work sites. The eagerly awaited food promised for Parcel Day arrives spoiled and defiled by rodents. The installations in the square see plenty of action as people are dragged in and punished for offenses so long overlooked we’ve forgotten they are illegal.<br/>Gale goes home with no more talk of rebellion between us. But I can’t help thinking that everything he sees will only strengthen his resolve to fight back. The hardships in the mines, the tortured bodies in the square, the hunger on the faces of his family. Rory has signed up for tesserae, something Gale can’t even speak about, but it’s still not enough with the inconsistent availability and the ever-increasing price of food.<br/>The only bright spot is, I get Haymitch to hire Hazelle as a housekeeper, resulting in some extra money for her and greatly increasing Haymitch’s standard of living. It’s weird going into his house, finding it fresh and clean, food warming on the stove. He hardly notices because he’s fighting a whole different battle. Peeta and I tried to ration what white liquor we had, but it’s almost run out, and the last time I saw Ripper, she was in the stocks.<br/>I feel like a pariah when I walk through the streets. Everyone avoids me in public now. But there’s no shortage of company at home. A steady supply of ill and injured is deposited in our kitchen before my mother, who has long since stopped charging for her services. Her stocks of remedies are running so low, though, that soon all she’ll have to treat the patients with is snow.<br/>The woods, of course, are forbidden. Absolutely. No question. Even Gale doesn’t challenge this now. But one morning, I do. And it isn’t the house full of the sick and dying, the bleeding backs, the gaunt-faced children, the marching boots, or the omnipresent misery that drives me under the fence. It’s the arrival of a crate of wedding dresses one night with a note from Effie saying that President Snow approved these himself.</td>

<td>Well, then this is your lucky day,” I say, dropping my game bag on the floor. People are starving all over the district and we still have more than enough. So I’ve been spreading things around a little. I have my own priorities: Gale’s family, Greasy Sae, some of the other Hob traders who were shut down. My mother has other people, patients mostly, who she wants to help. This morning I purposely overstuffed my game bag with food, knowing my mother would see the depleted pantry and assume I was making my rounds to the hungry. I was actually buying time to go to the lake without her worrying. I intended to deliver the food this evening on my return, but now I can see that won’t be happening.<br/>From the bag I pull two fresh buns with a layer of cheese baked into the top. We always seem to have a supply of these since Peeta found out they were my favorite. I toss one to Twill but cross over and place the other on Bonnie’s lap since her hand-eye coordination seems a little questionable at the moment and I don’t want the thing ending up in the fire.<br/>“Oh,” says Bonnie. “Oh, is this all for me?”<br/>Something inside me twists as I remember another voice. Rue. In the arena. When I gave her the leg of groosling. “Oh, I’ve never had a whole leg to myself before.” The disbelief of the chronically hungry.<br/>“Yeah, eat up,” I say. Bonnie holds the bun as if she can’t quite believe it’s real and then sinks her teeth into it again and again, unable to stop. “It’s better if you chew it.” She nods, trying to slow down, but I know how hard it is when you’re that hollow. “I</td>

<td>Ever since the Hunger Games, the discontent in District 8 had been growing. It was always there, of course, to some degree. But what differed was that talk was no longer sufficient, and the idea of taking action went from a wish to a reality. The textile factories that service Panem are loud with machinery, and the din also allowed word to pass safely, a pair of lips close to an ear, words unnoticed, unchecked. Twill taught at school, Bonnie was one of her pupils, and when the final bell had rung, both of them spent a fourhour shift at the factory that specialized in the Peacekeeper uniforms. It took months for Bonnie, who worked in the chilly inspection dock, to secure the two uniforms, a boot here, a pair of pants there. They were intended for Twill and her husband because it was understood that, once the uprising began, it would be crucial to get word of it out beyond District 8 if it were to spread and be successful.<br/>The day Peeta and I came through and made our Victory Tour appearance was actually a rehearsal of sorts. People in the crowd positioned themselves according to their teams, next to the buildings they would target when the rebellion broke out. That was the plan: to take over the centers of power in the city like the Justice Building, the Peacekeepers’ Headquarters, and the Communication Center in the square. And at other locations in the district: the railroad, the granary, the power station, and the armory.<br/>The night of my engagement, the night Peeta fell to his knees and proclaimed his undying love for me in front of the cameras in the Capitol, was the night the uprising began. It was an ideal cover. Our Victory Tour interview with Caesar Flickerman was mandatory viewing. It gave the people of District 8 a reason to be out on the streets after dark, gathering either in the square or in various community centers around the city to watch. Ordinarily such activity would have been too suspicious. Instead everyone was in place by the appointed hour, eight o’clock, when the masks went on and all hell broke loose.<br/>Taken by surprise</td>

Hovercraft bombed the rebel strongholds into ashes. In the utter chaos that followed, it was all people could do to make it back to their homes alive. It took less than forty-eight hours to subdue the city. Then, for a week, there was a lockdown. No food, no coal, everyone forbidden to leave their homes. The only time the television showed anything but static was when the suspected instigators were hanged in the square. Then one night, as the whole district was on the brink of starvation, came the order to return to business as usual.<br/>That meant school for Twill and Bonnie. A street made impassable by the bombs caused them to be late for their factory shift, so they were still a hundred yards away when it exploded, killing everyone inside—including Twill’s husband and Bonnie’s entire family.<br/>“Someone must have told the Capitol that the idea for the uprising had started there,” Twill tells me faintly.</td>

A shot of a bird? You think you’re going to find some new city with people strolling around in it? And that’s just fine with the Capitol?”<br/>“No,” Twill says earnestly. “We think the people moved underground when everything on the surface was destroyed. We think they’ve managed to survive. And we think the Capitol leaves them alone because, before the Dark Days, District Thirteen’s principal industry was nuclear development.”<br/>“They were graphite miners,” I say. But then I hesitate, because that’s information I got from the Capitol.<br/>“They had a few small mines, yes. But not enough to justify a population of that size.

<td>Head Peacekeeper Thread sent us with a message for you,” says the woman.<br/>“They’ve been waiting for hours,” my mother adds.<br/>They’ve been waiting for me to fail to return. To confirm I got electrocuted by the fence or trapped in the woods so they could take my family in for questioning.<br/>“Must be an important message,” I say.<br/>“May we ask where you’ve been, Miss Everdeen?” the woman asks.<br/>“Easier to ask where I haven’t been,” I say with a sound of exasperation. I cross into the kitchen, forcing myself to use my foot normally even though every step is excruciating. I pass between the Peacekeepers and make it to the table all right. I fling my bag down and turn to Prim, who’s standing stiffly by the hearth. Haymitch and Peeta are there as well, sitting in a pair of matching rockers, playing a game of chess. Were they here by chance or “invited” by the Peacekeepers? Either way, I’m glad to see them.<br/>“So where haven’t you been?” says Haymitch in a bored voice.<br/>“Well, I haven’t been talking to the Goat Man about getting Prim’s goat pregnant, because someone gave me completely inaccurate information as to where he lives,” I say to Prim emphatically.<br/>“No, I didn’t,” says Prim. “I told you exactly.”<br/>“You said he lives beside the west entrance to the mine,” I say.<br/>“The east entrance,” Prim corrects me.<br/>“You distinctly said the west, because then I said, ‘Next to the slag heap?’ and you said, ‘Yeah,’” I say.<br/>“The slag heap next to the east entrance,” says Prim patiently.<br/>“No. When did you say that?” I demand.<br/>“Last night,” Haymitch chimes in.<br/>“It was definitely the east,” adds Peeta. He looks at Haymitch and they laugh. I glare at Peeta and he tries to look contrite. “I’m sorry, but it’s what I’ve been saying. You don’t listen when people talk to you.”<br/>“Bet people told you he didn’t live there today and you didn’t listen again,” says Haymitch.<br/>“Shut up, Haymitch,” I say, clearly indicating he’s right.<br/>Haymitch and Peeta crack up and Prim allows herself a smile.<br/>“Fine. Somebody else can arrange to get the stupid goat knocked up,” I say, which makes them laugh more. And I think, This is why they’ve made it this far, Haymitch and Peeta. Nothing throws them.<br/>I look at the Peacekeepers. The man’s smiling but the woman is unconvinced. “What’s in the bag?” she asks sharply.<br/>I know she’s hoping for game or wild plants. Something that clearly condemns me. I dump the contents on the table. “See for yourself.”<br/>“Oh, good,” says my mother, examining the cloth. “We’re running low on bandages.”<br/>Peeta comes to the table and opens the candy bag. “Ooh, peppermints,” he says, popping one in his mouth.<br/>“They’re mine.” I take a swipe for the bag. He tosses it to Haymitch, who stuffs a fistful of sweets in his mouth before passing the bag to a giggling Prim. “None of you deserves candy!” I say.<br/>“What, because we’re right?” Peeta wraps his arms around me. I give a small yelp of pain as my tailbone objects. I try to turn it into a sound of indignation, but I can see in his eyes that he knows I’m hurt. “Okay, Prim said west. I distinctly heard west. And we’re all idiots. How’s that?”<br/>“Better,” I say, and accept his kiss. Then I look at the Peacekeepers as if I’m suddenly remembering they’re there. “You have a message for me?”<br/>“From Head Peacekeeper Thread,” says the woman. “He wanted you to know that the fence surrounding District Twelve will now have electricity twenty-four hours a day.”<br/>“Didn’t it already?” I ask, a little too innocently.<br/>“He thought you might be interested in passing this information on to your cousin,” says the woman.<br/>“Thank you. I’ll tell him. I’m sure we’ll all sleep a little more soundly now that security has addressed that lapse.” I’m pushing things, I know it, but the comment gives me a sense of satisfaction.<br/>The woman’s jaw tightens.

<td>Peeta comes by every day to bring me cheese buns and begins to help me work on the family book. It’s an old thing, made of parchment and leather. Some herbalist on my mother’s side of the family started it ages ago. The book’s composed of page after page of ink drawings of plants with descriptions of their medical uses. My father added a section on edible plants that was my guidebook to keeping us alive after his death. For a long time, I’ve wanted to record my own knowledge in it. Things I learned from experience or from Gale, and then the information I picked up when I was training for the Games. I didn’t because I’m no artist and it’s so crucial that the pictures are drawn in exact detail. That’s where Peeta comes in. Some of the plants he knows already, others we have dried samples of, and others I have to describe. He makes sketches on scrap paper until I’m satisfied they’re right, then I let him draw them in the book. After that, I carefully print all I know about the plant.<br/>It’s quiet, absorbing work that helps take my mind off my troubles. I like to watch his hands as he works, making a blank page bloom with strokes of ink, adding touches of color to our previously black and yellowish book. His face takes on a special look when he concentrates. His usual easy expression is replaced by something more intense and removed that suggests an entire world locked away inside him. I’ve seen flashes of this before: in the arena, or when he speaks to a crowd, or that time he shoved the Peacekeepers’ guns away from me in District 11. I don’t know quite what to make of it. I also become a little fixated on his eyelashes, which ordinarily you don’t notice much because they’re so blond. But up close, in the sunlight slanting in from the window, they’re a light golden color and so long I don’t see how they keep from getting all tangled up when he blinks.</td>

Usually we only watch when it’s mandatory, because the mixture of propaganda and displays of the Capitol’s power—including clips from seventy-four years of Hunger Games—is so odious. But now I’m looking for something special. The mockingjay that Bonnie and Twill are basing all their hopes on. I know it’s probably foolishness, but if it is, I want to rule it out. And erase the idea of a thriving District 13 from my mind for good.<br/>My first sighting is in a news story referencing the Dark Days. I see the smoldering remains of the Justice Building in District 13 and just catch the black-and-white underside of a mockingjay’s wing as it flies across the upper right-hand corner. That doesn’t prove anything, really. It’s just an old shot that goes with an old tale.<br/>However, several days later, something else grabs my attention. The main newscaster is reading a piece about a shortage of graphite affecting the manufacturing of items in District 3. They cut to what is supposed to be live footage of a female reporter, encased in a protective suit, standing in front of the ruins of the Justice Building in 13. Through her mask, she reports that unfortunately a study has just today determined that the mines of District 13 are still too toxic to approach. End of story. But just before they cut back to the main newscaster, I see the unmistakable flash of that same mockingjay’s wing.<br/>The reporter has simply been incorporated into the old footage.

The president removes an envelope clearly marked with a 75. He runs his finger under the flap and pulls out a small square of paper.

I saw a multitude of other things. Being publicly humiliated, tortured, and executed. Fleeing through the wilderness, pursued by Peacekeepers and hovercraft. Marriage to Peeta with our children forced into the arena. But never that I myself would have to be a player in the Games again. Why? Because there’s no precedent for it. Victors are out of the reaping for life. That’s the deal if you win. Until now.<br/>There’s some kind of sheeting, the kind they put down when they paint. I pull it over me like a blanket. In the distance, someone is calling my name. But at the moment, I excuse myself from thinking about even those I love most. I think only of me. And what lies ahead.<br/>The sheeting’s stiff but holds warmth. My muscles relax, my heart rate slows. I see the wooden box in the little boy’s hands, President Snow drawing out the yellowed envelope. Is it possible that this was really the Quarter Quell written down seventy-five years ago? It seems unlikely. It’s just too perfect an answer for the troubles that face the Capitol today. Getting rid of me and subduing the districts all in one neat little package.<br/>I hear President Snow’s voice in my head. “On the seventy-fifth anniversary, as a reminder to the rebels that even the strongest among them cannot overcome the power of the Capitol, the male and female tributes will be reaped from their existing pool of victors.”<br/>Yes, victors are our strongest. They’re the ones who survived the arena and slipped the noose of poverty that strangles the rest of us. They, or should I say we, are the very embodiment of hope where there is no hope. And now twenty-three of us will be killed to show how even that hope was an illusion.<br/>I’m glad I won only last year. Otherwise I’d know all the other victors, not just because I see them on television but because they’re guests at every Games.

And now you’re here to ask me…what?” he says.<br/>I don’t answer. The window’s wide open and the wind cuts through me just as if I were outside.<br/>“I’ll admit, it was easier for the boy. He was here before I could snap the seal on a bottle. Begging me for another chance to go in.

For Peeta to live, even if it means Haymitch’s death. No, I don’t. He’s dreadful, of course, but Haymitch is my family now. What did I come for? I think. What could I possibly want here?<br/>“I came for a drink,” I say.<br/>Haymitch bursts out laughing and slams the bottle on the table before me. I run my sleeve across the top and take a couple gulps before I come up choking. It takes a few minutes to compose myself, and even then my eyes and nose are still streaming. But inside me, the liquor feels like fire and I like it.<br/>“</td>

<td>bottle again.<br/>“Peeta’s argument is that since I chose you, I now owe him. Anything he wants. And what he wants is the chance to go in again to protect you,” says Haymitch.<br/>I knew it. In this way, Peeta’s not hard to predict. While I was wallowing around on the floor of that cellar, thinking only of myself, he was here, thinking only of me. Shame isn’t a strong enough word for what I feel.<br/>“You could live a hundred lifetimes and not deserve him, you know,” Haymitch says.<br/>“Yeah, yeah,” I say brusquely. “No question, he’s the superior one in this trio. So, what are you going to do?”<br/>“I don’t know.” Haymitch sighs. “Go back in with you maybe, if I can. If my name’s drawn at the reaping, it won’t matter. He’ll just volunteer to take my place.”<br/>We sit for a while in silence. “It’d be bad for you in the arena, wouldn’t it? Knowing all the others?” I ask.<br/>“Oh, I think we can count on it being unbearable wherever I am.” He nods at the bottle. “Can I have that back now?”<br/>“No,” I say, wrapping my arms around it. Haymitch pulls another bottle out from under the table and gives the top a twist. But I realize I am not just here for a drink. There’s something else I want from Haymitch. “Okay, I figured out what I’m asking,” I say. “If it is Peeta and me in the Games, this time we try to keep him alive.”<br/>Something flickers across his bloodshot eyes. Pain.<br/>“Like you said, it’s going to be bad no matter how you slice it. And whatever Peeta wants, it’s his turn to be saved. We both owe him that.” My voice takes on a pleading tone. “Besides, the Capitol hates me so much, I’m as good as dead now. He still might have a chance. Please, Haymitch. Say you’ll help me.”<br/>He frowns at his bottle, weighing my words. “All right,” he says finally.<br/>“Thanks,” I say. I should go see Peeta now, but I don’t want to. My head’s spinning from the drink, and I’m so wiped out, who knows what he could get me to agree to? No, now I have to go home to face my mother and Prim.<br/>As I stagger up the steps to my house, the front door opens and Gale pulls me into his arms. “I was wrong. We should have gone when you said,” he whispers.<br/>“No,” I say. I’m having trouble focusing, and liquor keeps sloshing out of my bottle and down the back of Gale’s jacket, but he doesn’t seem to care.<br/>“It’s not too late,” he says.<br/>Over his shoulder, I see my mother and Prim clutching each other in the doorway. We run. They die. And now I’ve got Peeta to protect. End of discussion. “Yeah, it is.” My knees give way and he’s holding me up. As the alcohol overcomes my mind, I hear the glass bottle shatter on the floor. This seems appropriate since I have obviously lost my grip on everything.<br/>When I wake up, I barely get to the toilet before the white liquor makes its reappearance. It burns just as much coming up as it did going down, and tastes twice as bad. I’m trembling and sweaty when I finish vomiting, but at least most of the stuff is out of my system. Enough made it into my bloodstream, though, to result in a pounding headache, parched mouth, and boiling stomach.<br/>I turn on the shower and stand under the warm rain for a minute before I realize I’m still in my underclothes. My mother must have just stripped off my filthy outer ones and tucked me in bed. I throw the wet undergarments into the sink and pour shampoo on my head. My hands sting, and that’s when I notice the stitches, small and even, across one palm and up the side of the other hand. Vaguely I remember breaking that glass window last night. I scrub myself from head to toe, only stopping to throw up again right in the</td>

<td>Finally clean, I pull on my robe and head back to bed, ignoring my dripping hair. I climb under the blankets, sure this is what it must feel like to be poisoned. The footsteps on the stairs renew my panic from last night. I’m not ready to see my mother and Prim. I have to pull myself together to be calm and reassuring, the way I was when we said our good-byes the day of the last reaping. I have to be strong. I struggle into an upright position, push my wet hair off my throbbing temples, and brace myself for this meeting. They appear in the doorway, holding tea and toast, their faces filled with concern. I open my mouth, planning to start off with some kind of joke, and burst into tears.<br/>So much for being strong.<br/>My mother sits on the side of the bed and Prim crawls right up next to me and they hold me, making quiet soothing sounds, until I am mostly cried out. Then Prim gets a towel and dries my hair, combing out the knots, while my mother coaxes tea and toast into me. They dress me in warm pajamas and layer more blankets on me and I drift off again.</td>

<td>My mother ladles out a mug of broth for me, and I ask for a second mug to take to Haymitch. Then I walk across the lawn to his house. He’s only just waking up and accepts the mug without comment. We sit there, almost peacefully, sipping our broth and watching the sun set through his living room window. I hear someone walking around upstairs and I assume it’s Hazelle, but a few minutes later Peeta comes down and tosses a cardboard box of empty liquor bottles on the table with finality.<br/>“There, it’s done,” he says.<br/>It’s taking all of Haymitch’s resources to focus his eyes on the bottles, so I speak up. “What’s done?”<br/>“I’ve poured all the liquor down the drain,” says Peeta.<br/>This seems to jolt Haymitch out of his stupor, and he paws through the box in disbelief. “You what?”<br/>“I tossed the lot,” says Peeta.<br/>“He’ll just buy more,” I say.<br/>“No, he won’t,” says Peeta. “I tracked down Ripper this morning and told her I’d turn her in the second she sold to either of you. I paid her off, too, just for good measure, but I don’t think she’s eager to be back in the Peacekeepers’ custody.”<br/>Haymitch takes a swipe with his knife but Peeta deflects it so easily it’s pathetic. Anger rises up in me. “What business is it of yours what he does?”<br/>“It’s completely my business. However it falls out, two of us are going to be in the arena again with the other as mentor. We can’t afford any drunkards on this team. Especially not you, Katniss,” says Peeta to me.<br/>“What?” I sputter indignantly. It would be more convincing if I weren’t still so hungover. “Last night’s the only time I’ve ever even been drunk.”<br/>“Yeah, and look at the shape you’re in,” says Peeta.<br/>I don’t know what I expected from my first meeting with Peeta after the announcement. A few hugs and kisses. A little comfort maybe. Not this. I turn to Haymitch. “Don’t worry, I’ll get you more liquor.”<br/>“Then I’ll turn you both in. Let you sober up in the stocks,” says Peeta.<br/>“What’s the point to this?” asks Haymitch.<br/>“The point is that two of us are coming home from the Capitol. One mentor and one victor,” says Peeta. “Effie’s sending me recordings of all the living victors. We’re going to watch their Games and learn everything we can about how they fight. We’re going to put on weight and get strong. We’re going to start acting like Careers. And one of us is going to be victor again whether you two like it or not!” He sweeps out of the room, slamming the front door.<br/>Haymitch and I wince at the bang.<br/>“I don’t like self-righteous people,” I say.<br/>“What’s to like?” says Haymitch, who begins sucking the dregs out of the empty bottles.<br/>“You and me. That’s who he plans on coming home,” I say.<br/>“Well, then the joke’s on him,” says Haymitch.<br/>But after a few days, we agree to act like Careers, because this is the best way to get Peeta ready as well. Every night we watch the old recaps of the Games that the remaining victors won. I realize we never met any of them on the Victory Tour, which seems odd in retrospect. When I bring it up, Haymitch says the last thing President Snow would’ve wanted was to show Peeta and me—especially me—bonding with other victors in potentially rebellious districts. Victors have a special status, and if they appeared to be supporting my defiance of the Capitol, it would’ve been dangerous politically. Adjusting for age, I realize some of our opponents may be elderly, which is both sad and reassuring. Peeta takes copious notes, Haymitch volunteers information about the victors’ personalities, and slowly we begin to know our competition.<br/>Every morning we do exercises to strengthen our bodies. We run and lift things and stretch our muscles. Every afternoon we work on combat skills, throwing knives, fighting hand to hand; I even teach them to climb trees. Officially, tributes aren’t supposed to train, but no one tries to stop us. Even in regular years, the tributes from Districts 1, 2, and 4 show up able to wield spears and swords. This is nothing by comparison.<br/>After all the years of abuse, Haymitch’s body resists improvement. He’s still remarkably strong, but the shortest run winds him. And you’d think a guy who sleeps every night with a knife might actually be able to hit the side of a house with one, but his hands shake so badly it takes weeks for him to achieve even that.<br/></td>

<td>Even Gale steps into the picture on Sundays, although he’s got no love for Peeta or Haymitch, and teaches us all he knows about snares. It’s weird for me, being in conversations with both Peeta and Gale, but they seem to have set aside whatever issues they have about me.<br/>One night, as I’m walking Gale back into town, he even admits, “It’d be better if he were easier to hate.”<br/>“Tell me about it,” I say. “If I could’ve just hated him in the arena, we all wouldn’t be in this mess now. He’d be dead, and I’d be a happy little victor all by myself.”<br/>“And where would we be, Katniss?” asks Gale.<br/>I pause, not knowing what to say. Where would I be with my pretend cousin who wouldn’t be my cousin if it weren’t for Peeta? Would he have still kissed me and would I have kissed him back had I been free to do so? Would I have let myself open up to him, lulled by the security of money and food and the illusion of safety being a victor could bring under different circumstances? But there would still always be the reaping looming over us, over our children. No matter what I wanted…<br/>“Hunting. Like every Sunday,” I say. I know he didn’t mean the question literally, but this is as much as I can honestly give. Gale knows I chose him over Peeta when I didn’t make a run for it. To me, there’s no point in talking about things that might have been. Even if I had killed Peeta in the arena, I still wouldn’t have wanted to marry anyone. I only got engaged to save people’s lives, and that completely backfired.<br/>I’m afraid, anyway, that any kind of emotional scene with Gale might cause him to do something drastic. Like start that uprising in the mines. And as Haymitch says, District 12 isn’t ready for that. If anything, they’re less ready than before the Quarter Quell announcement, because the following morning another hundred Peacekeepers arrived on the train.<br/>Since I don’t plan on making it back alive a second time, the sooner Gale lets me go, the better. I do plan on saying one or two things to him after the reaping, when we’re allowed an hour for good-byes. To let Gale know how essential he’s been to me all these years. How much better my life has been for knowing him. For loving him, even if it’s only in the limited way that I can</td>

I stand alone in a small roped-off area with Peeta and Haymitch in a similar pen to the right of me. The reaping takes only a minute. Effie, shining in a wig of metallic gold, lacks her usual verve. She has to claw around the girls’ reaping ball for quite a while to snag the one piece of paper that everyone already knows has my name on it. Then she catches Haymitch’s name.

This won’t happen if I’m mourning for everyone I love back home. Let them go, I tell myself. Say good-bye and forget them.

<td>Peeta and Effie make occasional attempts at conversation that quickly die out.<br/>“I love your new hair, Effie,” Peeta says.<br/>“Thank you. I had it especially done to match Katniss’s pin. I was thinking we might get you a golden ankle band and maybe find Haymitch a gold bracelet or something so we could all look like a team,” says Effie.<br/>Evidently, Effie doesn’t know that my mockingjay pin is now a symbol used by the rebels. At least in District 8. In the Capitol, the mockingjay is still a fun reminder of an especially exciting Hunger Games. What else could it be? Real rebels don’t put a secret symbol on something as durable as jewelry. They put it on a wafer of bread that can be eaten in a second if necessary.<br/>“I think that’s a great idea,” says Peeta. “How about it, Haymitch?”<br/>“Yeah, whatever,” says Haymitch. He’s not drinking but I can tell he’d like to be. Effie had them take her own wine away when she saw the effort he was making, but he’s in a miserable state. If he were the tribute, he would have owed Peeta nothing and could be as drunk as he liked. Now it’s going to take all he’s got to keep Peeta alive in an arena full of his old friends, and he’ll probably fail.<br/>“Maybe we could get you a wig, too,” I say in an attempt at lightness. He just shoots me a look that says to leave him alone, and we all eat our custard in silence.<br/>“Shall we watch the recap of the reapings?” says Effie, dabbing at the corners of her mouth with a white linen napkin.<br/>Peeta goes off to retrieve his notebook on the remaining living victors, and we gather in the compartment with the television to see who our competition will be in the arena. We are all in place as the anthem begins to play and the annual recap of the reaping ceremonies in the twelve districts begins.<br/>In the history of the Games, there have been seventy-five victors. Fifty-nine are still alive. I recognize many of their faces, either from seeing them as tributes or mentors at previous Games or from our recent viewing of the victors’ tapes. Some are so old or wasted by illness, drugs, or drink that I can’t place them. As one would expect, the pools of Career tributes from Districts 1, 2, and 4 are the largest. But every district has managed to scrape up at least one female and one male victor.<br/>The reapings go by quickly. Peeta studiously puts stars by the names of the chosen tributes in his notebook. Haymitch watches, his face devoid of emotion, as friends of his step up to take the stage. Effie makes hushed, distressed comments like “Oh, not Cecelia” or “Well, Chaff never could stay out of a fight,” and sighs frequently.<br/></td>

<td>For my part, I try to make some mental record of the other tributes, but like last year, only a few really stick in my head. There’s the classically beautiful brother and sister from District 1 who were victors in consecutive years when I was little. Brutus, a volunteer from District 2, who must be at least forty and apparently can’t wait to get back in the arena. Finnick, the handsome bronze-haired guy from District 4 who was crowned ten years ago at the age of fourteen. A hysterical young woman with flowing brown hair is also called from 4, but she’s quickly replaced by a volunteer, an eighty-year-old woman who needs a cane to walk to the stage. Then there’s Johanna Mason, the only living female victor from 7, who won a few years back by pretending she was a weakling. The woman from 8 who Effie calls Cecelia, who looks about thirty, has to detach herself from the three kids who run up to cling to her. Chaff, a man from 11 who I know to be one of Haymitch’s particular friends, is also in.<br/>I’m called. Then Haymitch. And Peeta volunteers. One of the announcers actually gets teary because it seems the odds will never be in our favor, we star-crossed lovers of District 12. Then she pulls herself together to say she bets that “these will be the best Games ever!”<br/></td>

All blond. All definitely merchants’ kids.<br/>“I think that’s your mother hugging her,” says Peeta quietly. And he’s right. As Maysilee Donner bravely disengages herself and heads for the stage, I catch a glimpse of my mother at my age, and no one has exaggerated her beauty. Holding her hand and weeping is another girl who looks just like Maysilee. But a lot like someone else I know, too.<br/>“Madge,” I say.<br/>“That’s her mother. She and Maysilee were twins or something,” Peeta says. “My dad mentioned it once.”<br/>I think of Madge’s mother. Mayor Undersee’s wife.

Of my mockingjay pin and how it means something completely different now that I know that its former owner was Madge’s aunt, Maysilee Donner, a tribute who was murdered in the arena.</td>

<td>Now it’s the morning the Games begin. We watch from the point of view of one of the tributes as she rises up through the tube from the Launch Room and into the arena. I can’t help but give a slight gasp. Disbelief is reflected on the faces of the players. Even Haymitch’s eyebrows lift in pleasure, although they almost immediately knit themselves back into a scowl.<br/>It’s the most breathtaking place imaginable. The golden Cornucopia sits in the middle of a green meadow with patches of gorgeous flowers. The sky is azure blue with puffy white clouds. Bright songbirds flutter overhead. By the way some of the tributes are sniffing, it must smell fantastic. An aerial shot shows that the meadow stretches for miles. Far in the distance, in one direction, there seems to be a woods, in the other, a snowcapped mountain.<br/>The beauty disorients many of the players, because when the gong sounds, most of them seem like they’re trying to wake from a dream. Not Haymitch, though. He’s at the Cornucopia, armed with weapons and a backpack of choice supplies. He heads for the woods before most of the others have stepped off their plates.<br/>Eighteen tributes are killed in the bloodbath that first day. Others begin to die off and it becomes clear that almost everything in this pretty place—the luscious fruit dangling from the bushes, the water in the crystalline streams, even the scent of the flowers when inhaled too directly—is deadly poisonous. Only the rainwater and the food provided at the Cornucopia are safe to consume. There’s also a large, well-stocked Career pack of ten tributes scouring the mountain area for victims.<br/>Haymitch has his own troubles over in the woods, where the fluffy golden squirrels turn out to be carnivorous and attack in packs, and the butterfly stings bring agony if not death. But he persists in moving forward, always keeping the distant mountain at his back.<br/>Maysilee Donner turns out to be pretty resourceful herself, for a girl who leaves the Cornucopia with only a small backpack. Inside she finds a bowl, some dried beef, and a blowgun with two dozen darts. Making use of the readily available poisons, she soon turns the blowgun into a deadly weapon by dipping the darts in lethal substances and directing them into her opponents’ flesh.<br/>Four days in, the picturesque mountain erupts in a volcano that wipes out another dozen players, including all but five of the Career pack. With the mountain spewing liquid fire, and the meadow offering no means of concealment, the remaining thirteen tributes—including Haymitch and Maysilee—have no choice but to confine themselves to the woods.<br/>Haymitch seems bent on continuing in the same direction, away from the now volcanic mountain, but a maze of tightly woven hedges forces him to circle back into the center of the woods, where he encounters three of the Careers and pulls his knife. They may be much bigger and stronger, but Haymitch has remarkable speed and has killed two when the third disarms him. That Career is about to slit his throat when a dart drops him to the ground.<br/>Maysilee Donner steps out of the woods. “We’d live longer with two of us.”<br/>“Guess you just proved that,” says Haymitch, rubbing his neck. “Allies?” Maysilee nods. And there they are, instantly drawn into one of those pacts you’d be hard-pressed to break if you ever expect to go home and face your district.<br/>Just like Peeta and me, they do better together. Get more rest, work out a system to salvage more rainwater, fight as a team, and share the food from the dead tributes’ packs. But Haymitch is still determined to keep moving on.<br/>“Why?” Maysilee keeps asking, and he ignores her until she refuses to move any farther without an answer.<br/>“Because it has to end somewhere, right?” says Haymitch. “The arena can’t go on forever.”<br/>“What do you expect to find?” Maysilee asks.<br/>“I don’t know. But maybe there’s something we can use,” he says.<br/>When they finally do make it through that impossible hedge, using a blowtorch from one of the dead Careers’ packs, they find themselves on flat, dry earth that leads to a cliff. Far below, you can see jagged rocks.<br/>“That’s all there is, Haymitch. Let’s go back,” says Maysilee.<br/>“No, I’m staying here,” he says.<br/>“All right. There’s only five of us left. May as well say good-bye now, anyway,” she says. “I don’t want it to come down to you and me.”<br/>“Okay,” he agrees. That’s all. He doesn’t offer to shake her hand or even look at her. And she walks away.<br/>Haymitch skirts along the edge of the cliff as if trying to figure something out. His foot dislodges a pebble and it falls into the abyss, apparently gone forever. But a minute later, as he sits to rest, the pebble shoots back up beside him. Haymitch stares at it, puzzled, and then his face takes on a strange intensity. He lobs a rock the size of his fist over the cliff and waits. When it flies back out and right into his hand, he starts laughing.<br/>That’s when we hear Maysilee begin to scream. The alliance is over and she broke it off, so no one could blame him for ignoring her. But Haymitch runs for her, anyway. He arrives only in time to watch the last of a flock of candy pink birds, equipped with long, thin beaks, skewer her through the neck. He holds her hand while she dies, and all I can think of is Rue and how I was too late to save her, too.<br/>Later that day, another tribute is killed in combat and a third gets eaten by a pack of those fluffy squirrels, leaving Haymitch and a girl from District 1 to vie for the crown. She’s bigger than he is and just as fast, and when the inevitable fight comes, it’s bloody and awful and both have received what could well be fatal wounds, when Haymitch is finally disarmed. He staggers through the beautiful woods, holding his intestines in, while she stumbles after him, carrying the ax that should deliver his deathblow. Haymitch makes a beeline for his cliff and has just reached the edge when she throws the ax. He collapses on the ground and it flies into the abyss. Now weaponless as well, the girl just stands there, trying to staunch the flow of blood pouring from her empty eye socket. She’s thinking perhaps that she can outlast Haymitch, who’s starting to convulse on the ground. But what she doesn’t know, and what he does, is that the ax will return. And when it flies back over the ledge, it buries itself in her head. The cannon sounds, her body is removed, and the trumpets blow to announce Haymitch’s victory.<br/>Peeta clicks off the tape and we sit there in silence for a while.<br/>Finally Peeta says, “That force field at the bottom of the cliff, it was like the one on the roof of the Training Center. The one that throws you back if you try to jump off and commit suicide. Haymitch found a way to turn it into a weapon.”<br/>“Not just against the other tributes, but the Capitol, too,” I say. “You know they didn’t expect that to happen. It wasn’t meant to be part of the arena. They never planned on anyone using it as a weapon. It made them look stupid that he figured it out. I bet they had a good time trying to spin that one. Bet that’s why I don’t remember seeing it on television. It’s almost as bad as us and the berries!”<br/>I can’t help laughing, really laughing, for the first time in months. Peeta just shakes his head like I’ve lost my mind—and maybe I have, a little.<br/>“Almost, but not quite,” says Haymitch from behind us. I whip around, afraid he’s going to be angry over us watching his tape, but he just smirks and takes a swig from a bottle of wine. So much for sobriety. I guess I should be upset he’s drinking again, but I’m preoccupied with another feeling.<br/>I’ve spent all these weeks getting to know who my competitors are, without even thinking about who my teammates are. Now a new kind of confidence is lighting up inside of me, because I think I finally know who Haymitch is. And I’m beginning to know who I am. And surely, two people who have caused the Capitol so much trouble can think of a way to get Peeta home alive.</td>

<td>Having been through prep with Flavius, Venia, and Octavia numerous times, it should just be an old routine to survive. But I haven’t anticipated the emotional ordeal that awaits me. At some point during the prep, each of them bursts into tears at least twice, and Octavia pretty much keeps up a running whimper throughout the morning. It turns out they really have become attached to me, and the idea of my returning to the arena has undone them. Combine that with the fact that by losing me they’ll be losing their ticket to all kinds of big social events, particularly my wedding, and the whole thing becomes unbearable. The idea of being strong for someone else having never entered their heads, I find myself in the position of having to console them. Since I’m the person going in to be slaughtered, this is somewhat annoying.<br/>It’s interesting, though, when I think of what Peeta said about the attendant on the train being unhappy about the victors having to fight again. About people in the Capitol not liking it. I still think all of that will be forgotten once the gong sounds, but it’s something of a revelation that those in the Capitol feel anything at all about us. They certainly don’t have a problem watching children murdered every year. But maybe they know too much about the victors, especially the ones who’ve been celebrities for ages, to forget we’re human beings. It’s more like watching your own friends die. More like the Games are for those of us in the districts.</td>

<td>When it’s time to get in costume for the opening ceremonies, my prep team shows up but Cinna sends them away, saying they’ve done such a spectacular job in the morning, there’s nothing left to do. They go off to recover, thankfully leaving me in Cinna’s hands. He puts up my hair first, in the braided style my mother introduced him to, then proceeds with my makeup. Last year he used little so that the audience would recognize me when I landed in the arena. But now my face is almost obscured by the dramatic highlights and dark shadows. High arching eyebrows, sharp cheekbones, smoldering eyes, deep purple lips. The costume looks deceptively simple at first, just a fitted black jumpsuit that covers me from the neck down. He places a half crown like the one I received as victor on my head, but it’s made of a heavy black metal, not gold. Then he adjusts the light in the room to mimic twilight and presses a button just inside the fabric on my wrist. I look down, fascinated, as my ensemble slowly comes to life, first with a soft golden light but gradually transforming to the orange-red of burning coal. I look as if I have been coated in glowing embers—no, that I am a glowing ember straight from our fireplace. The colors rise and fall, shift and blend, in exactly the way the coals do.<br/>“How did you do this?” I say in wonder.<br/>“Portia and I spent a lot of hours watching fires,” says Cinna. “Now look at yourself.”<br/>He turns me toward a mirror so that I can take in the entire effect. I do not see a girl, or even a woman, but some unearthly being who looks like she might make her home in the volcano that destroyed so many in Haymitch’s Quell. The black crown, which now appears red-hot, casts strange shadows on my dramatically made-up face. Katniss, the girl on fire, has left behind her flickering flames and bejeweled gowns and soft candlelight frocks. She is as deadly as fire itself.<br/>“I think…this is just what I needed to face the others,” I say.<br/>“Yes, I think your days of pink lipstick and ribbons are behind you,” says Cinna. He touches the button on my wrist again, extinguishing my light. “Let’s not run down your power pack. When you’re on the chariot this time, no waving, no smiling. I just want you to look straight ahead, as if the entire audience is beneath your notice.”<br/>“Finally something I’ll be good at,” I say.</td>

<td>Cinna has a few more things to attend to, so I decide to head down to the ground floor of the Remake Center, which houses the huge gathering place for the tributes and their chariots before the opening ceremonies. I’m hoping to find Peeta and Haymitch, but they haven’t arrived yet. Unlike last year, when all the tributes were practically glued to their chariots, the scene is very social. The victors, both this year’s tributes and their mentors, are standing around in small groups, talking. Of course, they all know one another and I don’t know anyone, and I’m not really the sort of person to go around introducing myself. So I just stroke the neck of one of my horses and try not to be noticed.<br/>It doesn’t work.<br/>The crunching hits my ear before I even know he’s beside me, and when I turn my head, Finnick Odair’s famous sea green eyes are only inches from mine. He pops a sugar cube in his mouth and leans against my horse.<br/>“Hello, Katniss,” he says, as if we’ve known each other for years, when in fact we’ve never met.<br/>“Hello, Finnick,” I say, just as casually, although I’m feeling uncomfortable at his closeness, especially since he’s got so much bare skin exposed.<br/>“Want a sugar cube?” he says, offering his hand, which is piled high. “They’re supposed to be for the horses, but who cares? They’ve got years to eat sugar, whereas you and I…well, if we see something sweet, we better grab it quick.”</td>

<td>Finnick Odair is something of a living legend in Panem. Since he won the Sixty-fifth Hunger Games when he was only fourteen, he’s still one of the youngest victors. Being from District 4, he was a Career, so the odds were already in his favor, but what no trainer could claim to have given him was his extraordinary beauty. Tall, athletic, with golden skin and bronze-colored hair and those incredible eyes. While other tributes that year were hard-pressed to get a handful of grain or some matches for a gift, Finnick never wanted for anything, not food or medicine or weapons. It took about a week for his competitors to realize that he was the one to kill, but it was too late. He was already a good fighter with the spears and knives he had found in the Cornucopia. When he received a silver parachute with a trident—which may be the most expensive gift I’ve ever seen given in the arena—it was all over. District 4’s industry is fishing. He’d been on boats his whole life. The trident was a natural, deadly extension of his arm. He wove a net out of some kind of vine he found, used it to entangle his opponents so he could spear them with the trident, and within a matter of days the crown was his.<br/>The citizens of the Capitol have been drooling over him ever since.<br/>Because of his youth, they couldn’t really touch him for the first year or two. But ever since he turned sixteen, he’s spent his time at the Games being dogged by those desperately in love with him. No one retains his favor for long. He can go through four or five in his annual visit. Old or young, lovely or plain, rich or very rich, he’ll keep them company and take their extravagant gifts, but he never stays, and once he’s gone he never comes back.<br/>I can’t argue that Finnick isn’t one of the most stunning, sensuous people on the planet. But I can honestly say he’s never been attractive to me. Maybe he’s too pretty, or maybe he’s too easy to get, or maybe it’s really that he’d just be too easy to lose.<br/>“No, thanks,” I say to the sugar. “I’d love to borrow your outfit sometime, though.”<br/>He’s draped in a golden net that’s strategically knotted at his groin so that he can’t technically be called naked, but he’s about as close as you can get. I’m sure his stylist thinks the more of Finnick the audience sees, the better.<br/>“You’re absolutely terrifying me in that getup. What happened to the pretty little-girl dresses?” he asks. He wets his lips just ever so slightly with his tongue. Probably this drives most people crazy. But for some reason all I can think of is old Cray, salivating over some poor, starving young woman.<br/>“I outgrew them,” I say.<br/>Finnick takes the collar of</td>

<td>Peeta and I wait until the doors of the Training Center have closed behind us to relax. Cinna and Portia are there, pleased with our performance, and Haymitch has made an appearance this year as well, only he’s not at our chariot, he’s over with the tributes of District 11. I see him nod in our direction and then they follow him over to greet us.<br/>I know Chaff by sight because I’ve spent years watching him pass a bottle back and forth with Haymitch on television. He’s dark skinned, about six feet tall, and one of his arms ends in a stump because he lost his hand in the Games he won thirty years ago. I’m sure they offered him some artificial replacement, like they did Peeta when they had to amputate his lower leg, but I guess he didn’t take it.<br/>The woman, Seeder, looks almost like she could be from the Seam, with her olive skin and straight black hair streaked with silver. Only her golden brown eyes mark her as from another district. She must be around sixty, but she still looks strong, and there’s no sign she’s turned to liquor or morphling or any other chemical form of escape over the years. Before either of us says a word, she embraces me. I know somehow it must be because of Rue and Thresh. Before I can stop myself, I whisper, “The families?”<br/>“They’re alive,” she says back softly before letting me go.<br/>Chaff throws his good arm around me and gives me a big kiss right on the mouth. I jerk back, startled, while he and Haymitch guffaw.<br/>That’s about all the time we get before the Capitol attendants are firmly directing us toward the elevators. I get the distinct feeling they’re not comfortable with the camaraderie among the victors, who couldn’t seem to care less. As I walk toward the elevators, my hand still linked with Peeta’s, someone else rustles up to my side. The girl pulls off a headdress of leafy branches and tosses it behind her without bothering to look where it falls.<br/>Johanna Mason. From District 7. Lumber and paper, thus the tree. She won by very convincingly portraying herself as weak and helpless so that she would be ignored. Then she demonstrated a wicked ability to murder. She ruffles up her spiky hair and rolls her wide-set brown eyes. “Isn’t my costume awful? My stylist’s the biggest idiot in the Capitol. Our tributes have been trees for forty years under her. Wish I’d gotten Cinna. You look fantastic.”<br/>Girl talk. That thing I’ve always been so bad at. Opinions on clothes, hair, makeup. So I lie. “Yeah, he’s been helping me design my own clothing line. You should see what he can do with velvet.” Velvet. The only fabric I could think of off the top of my head.<br/>“I have. On your tour. That strapless number you wore in District Two? The deep blue one with the diamonds? So gorgeous I wanted to reach through the screen and tear it right off your back,” says Johanna.<br/>I bet you did, I think. With a few inches of my flesh.<br/>While we wait for the elevators, Johanna unzips the rest of her tree, letting it drop to the floor, and then kicks it away in disgust. Except for her forest green slippers, she doesn’t have on a stitch of clothing. “That’s better.”<br/>We end up on the same elevator with her, and she spends the whole ride to the seventh floor chatting to Peeta about his paintings while the light of his still-glowing costume reflects off her bare breasts. When she leaves, I ignore him, but I just know he’s grinning. I toss aside his hand as the doors close behind Chaff and Seeder, leaving us alone, and he breaks out laughing.<br/>“What?” I say, turning on him as we step out on our floor.<br/>“It’s you, Katniss. Can’t you see?” he says.<br/>“What’s me?” I say.<br/>“Why they’re all acting like this. Finnick with his sugar cubes and Chaff kissing you and that whole thing with Johanna stripping down.” He tries to take on a more serious tone, unsuccessfully. “They’re playing with you because you’re so…you know.”<br/>“No, I don’t know,” I say. And I really have no idea what he’s talking about.<br/>“It’s like when you wouldn’t look at me naked in the arena even though I was half dead. You’re so…pure,” he says finally.<br/>“I am not!” I say. “I’ve been practically ripping your clothes off every time there’s been a camera for the last year!”<br/></td>

Haymitch once told me they did something to Avoxes’ tongues so they could never talk again. In my head I hear Darius’s voice, playful and bright, ringing across the Hob to tease me. Not as my fellow victors make fun of me now, but because we genuinely liked each other. If Gale could see him…<br/>I know any move I would make toward Darius, any act of recognition, would only result in punishment for him. So we just stare into each other’s eyes.

Darius is right by me when I send the dish over, and we two are briefly side by side, obscured from view, as we scoop up the peas. For just one moment our hands meet. I can feel his skin, rough under the buttery sauce from the dish. In the tight, desperate clench of our fingers are all the words we will never be able to say.

But I swear she can make a decent fishhook out of anything—a thorn, a wishbone, an earring. After a while I tune out the trainer and simply try to copy whatever Mags does. When I make a pretty good hook out of a bent nail and fasten it to some strands of my hair, she gives me a toothless smile and an unintelligible comment I think might be praise. Suddenly I remember how she volunteered to replace the young, hysterical woman in her district. It couldn’t be because she thought she had any chance of winning. She did it to save the girl, just like I volunteered last year to save Prim. And I decide I want her on my team.<br/>Great.

<td>So I give up trying to make friends and go over to the archery range for some sanity. It’s wonderful there, getting to try out all the different bows and arrows. The trainer, Tax, seeing that the standing targets offer no challenge for me, begins to launch these silly fake birds high into the air for me to hit. At first it seems stupid, but it turns out to be kind of fun. Much more like hunting a moving creature. Since I’m hitting everything he throws up, he starts increasing the number of birds he sends airborne. I forget the rest of the gym and the victors and how miserable I am and lose myself in the shooting. When I manage to take down five birds in one round, I realize it’s so quiet I can hear each one hit the floor. I turn and see the majority of the victors have stopped to watch me. Their faces show everything from envy to hatred to admiration.<br/>After training, Peeta and I hang out, waiting for Haymitch and Effie to show up for dinner. When we’re called to eat, Haymitch pounces on me immediately. “So at least half the victors have instructed their mentors to request you as an ally. I know it can’t be your sunny personality.”<br/>“They saw her shoot,” says Peeta with a smile. “Actually, I saw her shoot, for real, for the first time. I’m about to put in a formal request myself.”<br/>“You’re that good?” Haymitch asks me. “So good that Brutus wants you?”<br/>I shrug. “But I don’t want Brutus. I want Mags and District Three.”<br/>“Of course you do.” Haymitch sighs and orders a bottle of wine. “I’ll tell everybody you’re still making up your mind.”<br/>After my shooting exhibition, I still get teased some, but I no longer feel like I’m being mocked. In fact, I feel as if I’ve somehow been initiated into the victors’ circle. During the next two days, I spend time with almost everybody headed for the arena. Even the morphlings, who, with Peeta’s help, paint me into a field of yellow flowers. Even Finnick, who gives me an hour of trident lessons in exchange for an hour of archery instruction. And the more I come to know these people, the worse it is. Because, on the whole, I don’t hate them. And some I like. And a lot of them are so damaged that my natural instinct would be to protect them. But all of them must die if I’m to save Peeta.</td>

<td>They call Peeta, so I wait by myself. Fifteen minutes pass. Then half an hour. It’s close to forty minutes before I’m called.<br/>When I go in, I smell the sharp odor of cleaner and notice that one of the mats has been dragged to the center of the room. The mood is very different from last year’s, when the Gamemakers were half drunk and distractedly picking at tidbits from the banquet table. They whisper among themselves, looking somewhat annoyed. What did Peeta do? Something to upset them?<br/>I feel a pang of worry. That isn’t good. I don’t want Peeta singling himself out as a target for the Gamemakers’ anger. That’s part of my job. To draw fire away from Peeta. But how did he upset them? Because I’d love to do just that and more. To break through the smug veneer of those who use their brains to find amusing ways to kill us. To make them realize that while we’re vulnerable to the Capitol’s cruelties, they are as well.<br/>Do you have any idea how much I hate you? I think. You, who have given your talents to the Games?<br/>I try to catch Plutarch Heavensbee’s eye, but he seems to be intentionally ignoring me, as he has the entire training period. I remember how he sought me out for a dance, how pleased he was to show me the mockingjay on his watch. His friendly manner has no place here. How could it, when I’m a mere tribute and he’s the Head Gamemaker? So powerful, so removed, so safe…<br/>Suddenly I know just what I’m going to do. Something that will blow anything Peeta did right out of the water. I go over to the knot-tying station and get a length of rope. I start to manipulate it, but it’s hard because I’ve never made this actual knot myself. I’ve only watched Finnick’s clever fingers, and they moved so fast. After about ten minutes, I’ve come up with a respectable noose. I drag one of the target dummies out into the middle of the room and, using some chinning bars, hang it so it dangles by the neck. Tying its hands behind its back would be a nice touch, but I think I might be running out of time. I hurry over to the camouflage station, where some of the other tributes, undoubtedly the morphlings, have made a colossal mess. But I find a partial container of bloodred berry juice that will serve my needs. The flesh-colored fabric of the dummy’s skin makes a good, absorbent canvas. I carefully finger paint the words on its body, concealing them from view. Then I step away quickly to watch the reaction on the Gamemakers’ faces as they read the name on the dummy.<br/>SENECA CRANE.</td>

<td>The effect on the Gamemakers is immediate and satisfying. Several let out small shrieks. Others lose their grips on their wineglasses, which shatter musically against the ground. Two seem to be considering fainting. The look of shock is unanimous.<br/>Now I have Plutarch Heavensbee’s attention. He stares steadily at me as the juice from the peach he crushed in his hand runs through his fingers. Finally he clears his throat and says, “You may go now, Miss Everdeen.”<br/>I give a respectful nod and turn to go, but at the last moment I can’t resist tossing the container of berry juice over my shoulder. I can hear the contents splatter against the dummy while a couple more wineglasses break. As the elevator doors close before me, I see no one has moved.<br/>That surprised them, I think. It was rash and dangerous and no doubt I will pay for it ten times over. But for the moment, I feel something close to elation and I let myself savor it.<br/>I want to find Haymitch immediately and tell him about my session, but no one’s around. I guess they’re getting ready for dinner and I decide to go take a shower myself, since my hands are stained from the juice. As I stand in the water, I begin to wonder about the wisdom of my latest trick. The question that should now always be my guide is “Will this help Peeta stay alive?” Indirectly, this might not. What happens in training is highly secretive, so there’s no point in taking action against me when no one will know what my transgression was. In fact, last year I was rewarded for my brashness. This is a different sort of crime, though. If the Gamemakers are angry with me and decide to punish me in the arena, Peeta could get caught up in the attack as well. Maybe it was too impulsive. Still…I can’t say I’m sorry I did it.<br/>As we all gather for dinner, I notice Peeta’s hands are faintly stained with a variety of colors, even though his hair is still damp from bathing. He must have done some form of camouflage after all. Once the soup is served, Haymitch gets right to the issue on everyone’s mind. “All right, so how did your private sessions go?”<br/>I exchange a look with Peeta. Somehow I’m not that eager to put what I did into words. In the calm of the dining room, it seems very extreme. “You first,” I say to him. “It must have been really special. I had to wait for forty minutes to go in.”<br/>Peeta seems to be struck with the same reluctance I’m experiencing. “Well, I—I did the camouflage thing, like you suggested, Katniss.” He hesitates. “Not exactly camouflage. I mean, I used the dyes.”<br/>“To do what?” asks Portia.<br/>I think of how ruffled the Gamemakers were when I entered the gym for my session. The smell of cleaners. The mat pulled over that spot in the center of the gym. Was it to conceal something they were unable to wash away? “You painted something, didn’t you? A picture.”<br/>“Did you see it?” Peeta asks.<br/>“No. But they’d made a real point of covering it up,” I say.<br/>“Well, that would be standard. They can’t let one tribute know what another did,” says Effie, unconcerned. “What did you paint, Peeta?” She looks a little misty. “Was it a picture of Katniss?”<br/>“Why would he paint a picture of me, Effie?” I ask, somehow annoyed.<br/>“To show he’s going to do everything he can to defend you. That’s what everyone in the Capitol’s expecting, anyway. Didn’t he volunteer to go in with you?” Effie says, as if it’s the most obvious thing in the world.<br/>“Actually, I painted a picture of Rue,” Peeta says. “How she looked after Katniss had covered her in flowers.”<br/>There’s a long pause at the table while everyone absorbs this. “And what exactly were you trying to accomplish?” Haymitch asks in a very measured voice.<br/>“I’m not sure. I just wanted to hold them accountable, if only for a moment,” says Peeta. “For killing that little girl.”<br/>“This is dreadful.” Effie sounds like she’s about to cry. “That sort of thinking…it’s forbidden, Peeta. Absolutely. You’ll only bring down more trouble on yourself and Katniss.”<br/>“I have to agree with Effie on this one,” says Haymitch. Portia and Cinna remain silent, but their faces are very serious. Of course, they’re right. But even though it worries me, I think what he did was amazing.<br/>“I guess this is a bad time to mention I hung a dummy and painted Seneca Crane’s name on it,” I say. This has the desired effect. After a moment of disbelief, all the disapproval in the room hits me like a ton of bricks.<br/>“You…hung…Seneca Crane?” says Cinna.<br/>“Yes. I was showing off my new knot-tying skills, and he somehow ended up at the end of the noose,” I say.<br/>“Oh, Katniss,” says Effie in a hushed voice. “How do you even know about that?”<br/>“Is it a secret? President Snow didn’t act like it was. In fact, he seemed eager for me to know,” I say. Effie leaves the table with her napkin pressed to her face. “Now I’ve upset Effie. I should have lied and said I shot some arrows.”<br/>“You’d have thought we planned it,” says Peeta, giving me just the hint of a smile.<br/>“Didn’t you?” asks Portia. Her fingers press her eyelids closed as if she’s warding off a very bright light.<br/>“No,” I say, looking at Peeta with a new sense of appreciation. “Neither of us even knew what we were going to do before we went in.”<br/>“And, Haymitch?” says Peeta. “We decided we don’t want any other allies in the arena.”<br/>“Good. Then I won’t be responsible for you killing off any of my friends with your stupidity,” he says.<br/>“That’s just what we were thinking,” I tell him.<br/>We finish the meal in silence, but when we rise to go into the sitting room, Cinna puts his arm around me and gives me a squeeze. “Come on and let’s go get those training scores.”<br/>We gather around the television set and a red-eyed Effie rejoins us. The tributes’ faces come up, district by district, and their scores flash under their pictures. One through twelve. Predictably high scores for Cashmere, Gloss, Brutus, Enobaria, and Finnick. Low to medium for the rest.<br/>“Have they ever given a zero?” I ask.<br/>“No, but there’s a first time for everything,” Cinna answers.<br/>And it turns out he’s right. Because when Peeta and I each pull a twelve, we make Hunger Games history. No one feels like celebrating, though.<br/>“Why did they do that?” I ask.<br/>“So that the others will have no choice but to target you,” says Haymitch flatly. “Go to bed. I can’t stand to look at either one of you.”<br/></td>

<td>I’m sorry if I made things worse,” I say.<br/>“No worse than I did. Why did you do it, anyway?” he says.<br/>“I don’t know. To show them that I’m more than just a piece in their Games?” I say.<br/>He laughs a little, no doubt remembering the night before the Games last year. We were on the roof, neither of us able to sleep. Peeta had said something of the sort then, but I hadn’t understood what he meant. Now I do.<br/>“Me, too,” he tells me. “And I’m not saying I’m not going to try. To get you home, I mean. But if I’m perfectly honest about it…”<br/>“If you’re perfectly honest about it, you think President Snow has probably given them direct orders to make sure we die in the arena anyway,” I say.<br/>“It’s crossed my mind,” says Peeta.<br/>It’s crossed my mind, too. Repeatedly. But while I know I’ll never leave that arena alive, I’m still holding on to the hope that Peeta will. After all, he didn’t pull out those berries, I did. No one has ever doubted that Peeta’s defiance was motivated by love. So maybe President Snow will prefer keeping him alive, crushed and heartbroken, as a living warning to others.<br/>“But even if that happens, everyone will know we’ve gone out fighting, right?” Peeta asks.<br/>“Everyone will,” I reply. And for the first time, I distance myself from the personal tragedy that has consumed me since they announced the Quell. I remember the old man they shot in District 11, and Bonnie and Twill, and the rumored uprisings. Yes, everyone in the districts will be watching me to see how I handle this death sentence, this final act of President Snow’s dominance. They will be looking for some sign that their battles have not been in vain. If I can make it clear that I’m still defying the Capitol right up to the end, the Capitol will have killed me…but not my spirit. What better way to give hope to the rebels?<br/>The beauty of this idea is that my decision to keep Peeta alive at the expense of my own life is itself an act of defiance. A refusal to play the Hunger Games by the Capitol’s rules. My private agenda dovetails completely with my public one. And if I really could save Peeta…in terms of a revolution, this would be ideal. Because I will be more valuable dead. They can turn me into some kind of martyr for the cause and paint my face on banners, and it will do more to rally people than anything I could do if I was living. But Peeta would be more valuable alive, and tragic, because he will be able to turn his pain into words that will transform people.</td>

I didn’t realize until now how starved I’ve been for human closeness. For the feel of him beside me in the darkness. I wish I hadn’t wasted the last couple of nights shutting him out.

But then the redheaded Avox girl comes in with a note from Effie saying that, given our recent tour, both she and Haymitch have agreed we can handle ourselves adequately in public. The coaching sessions have been canceled.<br/>“Really?” says Peeta, taking the note from my hand and examining it. “Do you know what this means? We’ll have the whole day to ourselves.”<br/>“It’s too bad we can’t go somewhere,” I say wistfully.<br/>“Who says we can’t?” he asks.<br/>The roof. We order a bunch of food, grab some blankets, and head up to the roof for a picnic. A daylong picnic in the flower garden that tinkles with wind chimes. We eat. We lie in the sun. I snap off hanging vines and use my newfound knowledge from training to practice knots and weave nets. Peeta sketches me. We make up a game with the force field that surrounds the roof—one of us throws an apple into it and the other person has to catch it.<br/>No one bothers us. By late afternoon, I lie with my head on Peeta’s lap, making a crown of flowers while he fiddles with my hair, claiming he’s practicing his knots. After a while, his hands go still. “What?” I ask.<br/>“I wish I could freeze this moment, right here, right now, and live in it forever,” he says.<br/>Usually this sort of comment, the kind that hints of his undying love for me, makes me feel guilty and awful. But I feel so warm and relaxed and beyond worrying about a future I’ll never have, I just let the word slip out. “Okay.”<br/>I can hear the smile in his voice. “Then you’ll allow it?”<br/>“I’ll allow it,” I say.<br/>His fingers go back to my hair and I doze off, but he rouses me to see the sunset. It’s a spectacular yellow and orange blaze behind the skyline of the Capitol. “I didn’t think you’d want to miss it,” he says.<br/>“Thanks,” I say. Because I can count on my fingers the number of sunsets I have left, and I don’t want to miss any of them.<br/>We don’t go and join the others for dinner, and no one summons us.<br/>“I’m glad.

<td>, what am I wearing tonight?” I ask, eyeing the garment bag that holds my dress.<br/>“President Snow put in the dress order himself,” says Cinna. He unzips the bag, revealing one of the wedding dresses I wore for the photo shoot. Heavy white silk with a low neckline and tight waist and sleeves that fall from my wrists to the floor. And pearls. Everywhere pearls. Stitched into the dress and in ropes at my throat and forming the crown for the veil. “Even though they announced the Quarter Quell the night of the photo shoot, people still voted for their favorite dress, and this was the winner. The president says you’re to wear it tonight. Our objections were ignored.”<br/>I rub a bit of the silk between my fingers, trying to figure out President Snow’s reasoning. I suppose since I was the greatest offender, my pain and loss and humiliation should be in the brightest spotlight. This, he thinks, will make that clear. It’s so barbaric, the president turning my bridal gown into my shroud, that the blow strikes home, leaving me with a dull ache inside. “Well, it’d be a shame to waste such a pretty dress” is all I say.<br/>Cinna helps me carefully into the gown. As it settles on my shoulders, they can’t help giving a shrug of complaint. “Was it always this heavy?” I ask. I remember several of the dresses being dense, but this one feels like it weighs a ton.<br/>“I had to make some slight alterations because of the lighting,” says Cinna. I nod, but I can’t see what that has to do with anything. He decks me out in the shoes and the pearl jewelry and the veil. Touches up my makeup. Has me walk.<br/>“You’re ravishing,” he says. “Now, Katniss, because this bodice is so fitted, I don’t want you raising your arms above your head. Well, not until you twirl, anyway.”<br/>“Will I be twirling again?” I ask, thinking of my dress last year.<br/>“I’m sure Caesar will ask you. And if he doesn’t, you suggest it yourself. Only not right away. Save it for your big finale,” Cinna instructs me.<br/>“You give me a signal so I know when,” I say.<br/>“All right. Any plans for your interview? I know </td>

<td>We meet up with Effie, Haymitch, Portia, and Peeta at the elevator. Peeta’s in an elegant tuxedo and white gloves. The sort of thing grooms wear to get married in, here in the Capitol.<br/>Back home everything is so much simpler. A woman usually rents a white dress that’s been worn hundreds of times. The man wears something clean that’s not mining clothes. They fill out some forms at the Justice Building and are assigned a house. Family and friends gather for a meal or bit of cake, if it can be afforded. Even if it can’t, there’s always a traditional song we sing as the new couple crosses the threshold of their home. And we have our own little ceremony, where they make their first fire, toast a bit of bread, and share it. Maybe it’s old-fashioned, but no one really feels married in District 12 until after the toasting.</td>

<td>The other tributes have already gathered offstage and are talking softly, but when Peeta and I arrive, they fall silent. I realize everyone’s staring daggers at my wedding dress. Are they jealous of its beauty? The power it might have to manipulate the crowd?<br/>Finally Finnick says, “I can’t believe Cinna put you in that thing.”<br/>“He didn’t have any choice. President Snow made him,” I say, somewhat defensively. I won’t let anyone criticize Cinna.<br/>Cashmere tosses her flowing blond curls back and spits out, “Well, you look ridiculous!” She grabs her brother’s hand and pulls him into place to lead our procession onto the stage. The other tributes begin to line up as well. I’m confused because, while they all are angry, some are giving us sympathetic pats on the shoulder, and Johanna Mason actually stops to straighten my pearl necklace.<br/>“Make him pay for it, okay?” she says.<br/>I nod, but I don’t know what she means. Not until we’re all sitting out onstage and Caesar Flickerman, hair and face highlighted in lavender this year, has done his opening spiel and the tributes begin their interviews. This is the first time I realize the depth of betrayal felt among the victors and the rage that accompanies it. But they are so smart, so wonderfully smart about how they play it, because it all comes back to reflect on the government and President Snow in particular. Not everyone. There are the old throwbacks, like Brutus and Enobaria, who are just here for another Games, and those too baffled or drugged or lost to join in on the attack. But there are enough victors who still have the wits and the nerve to come out fighting.<br/>Cashmere starts the ball rolling with a speech about how she just can’t stop crying when she thinks of how much the people in the Capitol must be suffering because they will lose us. Gloss recalls the kindness shown here to him and his sister. Beetee questions the legality of the Quell in his nervous, twitchy way, wondering if it’s been fully examined by experts of late. Finnick recites a poem he wrote to his one true love in the Capitol, and about a hundred people faint because they’re sure he means them. By the time Johanna Mason gets up, she’s asking if something can’t be done about the situation. Surely the creators of the Quarter Quell never anticipated such love forming between the victors and the Capitol. No one could be so cruel as to sever such a deep bond. Seeder quietly ruminates about how, back in District 11, everyone assumes President Snow is all-powerful. So if he’s all-powerful, why doesn’t he change the Quell? And Chaff, who comes right on her heels, insists the president could change the Quell if he wanted to, but he must not think it matters much to anyone.</td>

<td>By the time I’m introduced, the audience is an absolute wreck. People have been weeping and collapsing and even calling for change. The sight of me in my white silk bridal gown practically causes a riot. No more me, no more star-crossed lovers living happily ever after, no more wedding. I can see even Caesar’s professionalism showing some cracks as he tries to quiet them so I can speak, but my three minutes are ticking quickly away.<br/>Finally there’s a lull and he gets out, “So, Katniss, obviously this is a very emotional night for everyone. Is there anything you’d like to say?”<br/>My voice trembles as I speak. “Only that I’m so sorry you won’t get to be at my wedding…but I’m glad you at least get to see me in my dress. Isn’t it just…the most beautiful thing?” I don’t have to look at Cinna for a signal. I know this is the right time. I begin to twirl slowly, raising the sleeves of my heavy gown above my head.<br/>When I hear the screams of the crowd, I think it’s because I must look stunning. Then I notice something is rising up around me. Smoke. From fire. Not the flickery stuff I wore last year in the chariot, but something much more real that devours my dress. I begin to panic as the smoke thickens. Charred bits of black silk swirl into the air, and pearls clatter to the stage. Somehow I’m afraid to stop because my flesh doesn’t seem to be burning and I know Cinna must be behind whatever is happening. So I keep spinning and spinning. For a split second I’m gasping, completely engulfed in the strange flames. Then all at once, the fire is gone. I slowly come to a stop, wondering if I’m naked and why Cinna has arranged to burn away my wedding dress.<br/>But I’m not naked. I’m in a dress of the exact design of my wedding dress, only it’s the color of coal and made of tiny feathers. Wonderingly, I lift my long, flowing sleeves into the air, and that’s when I see myself on the television screen. Clothed in black except for the white patches on my sleeves. Or should I say my wings.<br/>Because Cinna has turned me into a mockingjay.</td>

<td>As I pass Peeta, who’s headed for his interview, he doesn’t meet my eyes. I take my seat carefully, but aside from the puffs of smoke here and there, I seem unharmed, so I turn my attention to him.<br/>Caesar and Peeta have been a natural team since they first appeared together a year ago. Their easy give-and-take, comic timing, and ability to segue into heart-wrenching moments, like Peeta’s confession of love for me, have made them a huge success with the audience. They effortlessly open with a few jokes about fires and feathers and overcooking poultry. But anyone can see that Peeta is preoccupied, so Caesar directs the conversation right into the subject that’s on everyone’s minds.<br/>“So, Peeta, what was it like when, after all you’ve been through, you found out about the Quell?” asks Caesar.<br/>“I was in shock. I mean, one minute I’m seeing Katniss looking so beautiful in all these wedding gowns, and the next…” Peeta trails off.<br/>“You realized there was never going to be a wedding?” asks Caesar gently.<br/>Peeta pauses for a long moment, as if deciding something. He looks out at the spellbound audience, then at the floor, then finally up at Caesar. “Caesar, do you think all our friends here can keep a secret?”<br/>An uncomfortable laugh emanates from the audience. What can he mean? Keep a secret from who? Our whole world is watching.<br/>“I feel quite certain of it,” says Caesar.<br/>“We’re already married,” says Peeta quietly. The crowd reacts in astonishment, and I have to bury my face in the folds of my skirt so they can’t see my confusion. Where on earth is he going with this?<br/>“But…how can that be?” asks Caesar.<br/>“Oh, it’s not an official marriage. We didn’t go to the Justice Building or anything. But we have this marriage ritual in District Twelve. I don’t know what it’s like in the other districts. But there’s this thing we do,” says Peeta, and he briefly describes the toasting.<br/>“Were your families there?” asks Caesar.<br/>“No, we didn’t tell anyone. Not even Haymitch. And Katniss’s mother would never have approved. But you see, we knew if we were married in the Capitol, there wouldn’t be a toasting. And neither of us really wanted to wait any longer. So one day, we just did it,” Peeta says. “And to us, we’re more married than any piece of paper or big party could make us.”<br/>“So this was before the Quell?” says Caesar.<br/>“Of course before the Quell. I’m sure we’d never have done it after we knew,” says Peeta, starting to get upset. “But who could’ve seen it coming? No one. We went through the Games, we were victors, everyone seemed so thrilled to see us together, and then out of nowhere—I mean, how could we anticipate a thing like that?”<br/>“You couldn’t, Peeta.” Caesar puts an arm around his shoulders. “As you say, no one could’ve. But I have to confess, I’m glad you two had at least a few months of happiness together.”<br/>Enormous applause. As if encouraged, I look up from my feathers and let the audience see my tragic smile of thanks. The residual smoke from the feathers has made my eyes teary, which adds a very nice touch.<br/>“I’m not glad,” says Peeta. “I wish we had waited until the whole thing was done officially.”<br/>This takes even Caesar aback. “Surely even a brief time is better than no time?”<br/>“Maybe I’d think that, too, Caesar,” says Peeta bitterly, “if it weren’t for the baby.”<br/>There. He’s done it again. Dropped a bomb that wipes out the efforts of every tribute who came before him. Well, maybe not. Maybe this year he has only lit the fuse on a bomb that the victors themselves have been building. Hoping someone would be able to detonate it. Perhaps thinking it would be me in my bridal gown. Not knowing how much I rely on Cinna’s talents, whereas Peeta needs nothing more than his wits.<br/>As the bomb explodes, it sends accusations of injustice and barbarism and cruelty flying out in every direction. Even the most Capitol-loving, Games-hungry, bloodthirsty person out there can’t ignore, at least for a moment, how horrific the whole thing is.<br/>I am pregnant.<br/>The audience can’t absorb the news right away. It has to strike them and sink in and be confirmed by other voices before they begin to sound like a herd of wounded animals, moaning, shrieking, calling for help. And me? I know my face is projected in a tight close-up on the screen, but I don’t make any effort to hide it. Because for a moment, even I am working through what Peeta has said. Isn’t it the thing I dreaded most about the wedding, about the future—the loss of my children to the Games? And it could be true now, couldn’t it? If I hadn’t spent my life building up layers of defenses until I recoil at even the suggestion of marriage or a family?<br/>Caesar can’t rein in the crowd again, not even when the buzzer sounds. Peeta nods his good-bye and comes back to his seat without any more conversation. I can see Caesar’s lips moving, but the place is in total chaos and I can’t hear a word. Only the blast of the anthem, cranked up so loud I can feel it vibrating through my bones, lets us know where we stand in the program. I automatically rise and, as I do, I sense Peeta reaching out for me. Tears run down his face as I take his hand. How real are the tears? Is this an acknowledgment that he has been stalked by the same fears that I have? That every victor has? Every parent in every district in Panem?<br/>I look back to the crowd, but the faces of Rue’s mother and father swim before my eyes. Their sorrow. Their loss. I turn spontaneously to Chaff and offer my hand. I feel my fingers close around the stump that now completes his arm and hold fast.<br/>And then it happens. Up and down the row, the victors begin to join hands. Some right away, like the morphlings, or Wiress and Beetee. Others unsure but caught up in the demands of those around them, like Brutus and Enobaria. By the time the anthem plays its final strains, all twenty-four of us stand in one unbroken line in what must be the first public show of unity among the districts since the Dark Days. You can see the realization of this as the screens begin to pop into blackness. It’s too late, though. In the confusion they didn’t cut us off in time. Everyone has seen.<br/>There’s disorder on the stage now, too, as the lights go out and we’re left to stumble back into the Training Center. I’ve lost hold of Chaff, but Peeta guides me into an elevator. Finnick and Johanna try to join us, but a harried Peacekeeper blocks their way and we shoot upward alone.<br/>The moment we step off the elevator, Peeta grips my shoulders. “There isn’t much time, so tell me. Is there anything I have to apologize for?”<br/>“Nothing,” I say. It was a big leap to take without my okay, but I’m just as glad I didn’t know, didn’t have time to second-guess him, to let any guilt over Gale detract from how I really feel about what Peeta did. Which is empowered.<br/>Somewhere, very far off, is a place called District 12, where my mother and sister and friends will have to deal with the fallout from this night. Just a brief hovercraft ride away is an arena where, tomorrow, Peeta and I and the other tributes will face our own form of punishment. But even if all of us meet terrible ends, something happened on that stage tonight that can’t be undone. We victors staged our own uprising, and maybe, just maybe, the Capitol won’t be able to contain this one.</td>

<td>I know I should say a whole bunch of things to Haymitch, but I can’t think of anything he doesn’t already know, really, and my throat is so tight I doubt anything would come out, anyway. So, once again, I let Peeta speak for us both.<br/>“You take care, Haymitch,” he says.<br/>We cross the room, but in the doorway, Haymitch’s voice stops us. “Katniss, when you’re in the arena,” he begins. Then he pauses. He’s scowling in a way that makes me sure I’ve already disappointed him.<br/>“What?” I ask defensively.<br/>“You just remember who the enemy is,” Haymitch tells me. “That’s all. Now go on. Get out of here.”</td>

<td>There’s someone behind me. I’m alerted by, I don’t know, a soft shift of sand or maybe just a change in the air currents. I pull an arrow from the sheath that’s still wedged in the pile and arm my bow as I turn.<br/>Finnick, glistening and gorgeous, stands a few yards away, with a trident poised to attack. A net dangles from his other hand. He’s smiling a little, but the muscles in his upper body are rigid in anticipation. “You can swim, too,” he says. “Where did you learn that in District Twelve?”<br/>“We have a big bathtub,” I answer.<br/>“You must,” he says. “You like the arena?”<br/>“Not particularly. But you should. They must have built it especially for you,” I say with an edge of bitterness. It seems like it, anyway, with all the water, when I bet only a handful of the victors can swim. And there was no pool in the Training Center, no chance to learn. Either you came in here a swimmer or you’d better be a really fast learner. Even participation in the initial bloodbath depends on being able to cover twenty yards of water. That gives District 4 an enormous advantage.<br/>For a moment we’re frozen, sizing each other up, our weapons, our skill. Then Finnick suddenly grins. “Lucky thing we’re allies. Right?”<br/>Sensing a trap, I’m about to let my arrow fly, hoping it finds his heart before the trident impales me, when he shifts his hand and something on his wrist catches the sunlight. A solid-gold bangle patterned with flames. The same one I remember on Haymitch’s wrist the morning I began training. I briefly consider that Finnick could have stolen it to trick me, but somehow I know this isn’t the case. Haymitch gave it to him. As a signal to me. An order, really. To trust Finnick.<br/>I can hear other footsteps approaching. I must decide at once. “Right!” I snap, because even though Haymitch is my mentor and trying to keep me alive, this angers me. Why didn’t he tell me he’d made this arrangement before? Probably because Peeta and I had ruled out allies. Now Haymitch has chosen one on his own.<br/>“Duck!” Finnick commands in such a powerful voice, so different from his usual seductive purr, that I do. His trident goes whizzing over my head and there’s a sickening sound of impact as it finds its target. The man from District 5, the drunk who threw up on the sword-fighting floor, sinks to his knees as Finnick frees the trident from his chest. </td>

Just as Haymitch intended,” I answer.<br/>“Remind me, did we make deals with anyone else?” Peeta asks.<br/>“Only Mags, I think,” I say. I nod toward the old woman doggedly making her way toward us.<br/>“Well, I can’t leave Mags behind,” says Finnick. “She’s one of the few people who actually likes me.”<br/>“I’ve got no problem with Mags,” I say. “Especially now that I see the arena. Her fishhooks are probably our best chance of getting a meal.”<br/>“Katniss wanted her on the first day,” says Peeta.<br/>“Katniss has remarkably good judgment,” says Finnick. With one hand he reaches into the water and scoops out Mags like she weighs no more than a puppy. She makes some remark that I think includes the word “bob,” then pats her belt.<br/>“Look, she’s right. Someone figured it out.” Finnick points to Beetee. He’s flailing around in the waves but managing to keep his head above water.<br/>“What?” I say.<br/>“The belts. They’re flotation devices,” says Finnick. “I mean, you have to propel yourself, but they’ll keep you from drowning.”<br/>I almost ask Finnick to wait, to get Beetee and </td>

<td>While the sun’s hot and bright, the air’s warm and heavy with moisture, and I get the feeling I will never really be dry here. The thin blue fabric of my jumpsuit lets the seawater evaporate easily, but it’s already begun to cling to me with sweat.<br/>Peeta takes the lead, cutting through the patches of dense vegetation with his long knife. I make Finnick go second because even though he’s the most powerful, he’s got his hands full with Mags. Besides, while he’s a whiz with that trident, it’s a weapon less suited to the jungle than my arrows. It doesn’t take long, between the steep incline and the heat, to become short of breath. Peeta and I have been training intensely, though, and Finnick’s such an amazing physical specimen that even with Mags over his shoulder, we climb rapidly for about a mile before he requests a rest. And then I think it’s more for Mags’s sake than his own.<br/>The foliage has hidden the wheel from sight, so I scale a tree with rubbery limbs to get a better view. And then wish that I hadn’t.<br/>Around the Cornucopia, the ground appears to be bleeding; the water has purple stains. Bodies lie on the ground and float in the sea, but at this distance, with everyone dressed exactly the same, I can’t tell who lives or dies. All I can tell is that some of the tiny blue figures still battle. Well, what did I think? That the victors’ chain of locked hands last night would result in some sort of universal truce in the arena? No, I never believed that. But I guess I had hoped people might show some…what? Restraint? Reluctance, at least. Before they jumped right into massacre mode. And you all knew each other, I think. You acted like friends.<br/>I have only one real friend in here. And he isn’t from District 4.<br/>I let the slight, soupy breeze cool my cheeks while I come to a decision. Despite the bangle, I should just get it over with and shoot Finnick. There’s really no future in this alliance. And he’s too dangerous to let go. Now, when we have this tentative trust, may be my only chance to kill him. I could easily shoot him in the back as we walk. It’s despicable, of course, but will it be any more despicable if I wait? Know him better? Owe him more? No, this is the time. I take one last look at the battling figures, the bloody ground, to harden my resolve, and then slide to the ground.<br/>But when I land, I find Finnick’s kept pace with my thoughts. As if he knows what I have seen and how it will have affected me. He has one of his tridents raised in a casually defensive position.<br/>“What’s going on down there, Katniss? Have they all joined hands? Taken a vow of nonviolence? Tossed the weapons in the sea in defiance of the Capitol?” Finnick asks.<br/>“No,” I say.<br/>“No,” Finnick repeats. “Because whatever happened in the past is in the past. And no one in this arena was a victor by chance.” He eyes Peeta for a moment. “Except maybe Peeta.”<br/>Finnick knows then what Haymitch and I know. About Peeta. Being truly, deep-down better than the rest of us. Finnick took out that tribute from 5 without blinking an eye. And how long did I take to turn deadly? I shot to kill when I targeted Enobaria and Gloss and Brutus. Peeta would at least have attempted negotiations first. Seen if some wider alliance was possible. But to what end? Finnick’s right. I’m right. The people in this arena weren’t crowned for their compassion.</td>

<td>I hold his gaze, weighing his speed against my own. The time it will take to send an arrow through his brain versus the time his trident will reach my body. I can see him, waiting for me to make the first move. Calculating if he should block first or go directly for an attack. I can feel we’ve both about worked it out when Peeta steps deliberately between us.<br/>“So how many are dead?” he asks.<br/>Move, you idiot, I think. But he remains planted firmly between us.<br/>“Hard to say,” I answer. “At least six, I think. And they’re still fighting.”<br/>“Let’s keep moving. We need water,” he says.<br/>So far there’s been no sign of a freshwater stream or pond, and the saltwater’s undrinkable. Again, I think of the last Games, where I nearly died of dehydration.<br/>“Better find some soon,” says Finnick. “We need to be undercover when the others come hunting us tonight.”<br/>We. Us. Hunting. All right, maybe killing Finnick would be a little premature. He’s been helpful so far. He does have Haymitch’s stamp of approval. And who knows what the night will hold? If worse comes to worst, I can always kill him in his sleep. So I let the moment pass. And so does Finnick.<br/>The absence of water intensifies my thirst. I keep a sharp eye out as we continue our trek upward, but with no luck. After about another mile, I can see an end to the tree line and assume we’re reaching the crest of the hill. “Maybe we’ll have better luck on the other side. Find a spring or something.”<br/>But there is no other side. I know this before anyone else, even though I am farthest from the top. My eyes catch on a funny, rippling square hanging like a warped pane of glass in the air. At first I think it’s the glare from the sun or the heat shimmering up off the ground. But it’s fixed in space, not shifting when I move. And that’s when I connect the square with Wiress and Beetee in the Training Center and realize what lies before us. My warning cry is just reaching my lips when Peeta’s knife swings out to slash away some vines.<br/>There’s a sharp zapping sound. For an instant, the trees are gone and I see open space over a short stretch of bare earth. Then Peeta’s flung back from the force field, bringing Finnick and Mags to the ground.<br/>I rush over to where he lies, motionless in a web of vines. “Peeta?” There’s a faint smell of singed hair. I call his name again, giving him a little shake, but he’s unresponsive. My fingers fumble across his lips, where there’s no warm breath although moments ago he was panting. I press my ear against his chest, to the spot where I always rest my head, where I know I will hear the strong and steady beat of his heart.<br/>Instead, I find silence.</td>

<td>There’s a force field up ahead.”<br/>I laugh, but there are tears running down my cheeks.<br/>“Must be a lot stronger than the one on the Training Center roof,” he says. “I’m all right, though. Just a little shaken.”<br/>“You were dead! Your heart stopped!” I burst out, before really considering if this is a good idea. I clap my hand over my mouth because I’m starting to make those awful choking sounds that happen when I sob.<br/>“Well, it seems to be working now,” he says. “It’s all right, Katniss.” I nod my head but the sounds aren’t stopping. “Katniss?” Now Peeta’s worried about me, which adds to the insanity of it all.<br/>“It’s okay. It’s just her hormones,” says Finnick. “From the baby.” I look up and see him, sitting back on his knees but still panting a bit from the climb and the heat and the effort of bringing Peeta back from the dead.<br/>“No. It’s not—” I get out, but I’m cut off by an even more hysterical round of sobbing that seems only to confirm what Finnick said about the baby. He meets my eyes and I glare at him through my tears. It’s stupid, I know, that his efforts make me so vexed. All I wanted was to keep Peeta alive, and I couldn’t and Finnick could, and I should be nothing but grateful. And I am. But I am also furious because it means that I will never stop owing Finnick Odair. Ever. So how can I kill him in his sleep?<br/>I expect to see a smug or sarcastic expression on his face, but his look is strangely quizzical. He glances between Peeta and me, as if trying to figure something out, then gives his head a slight shake as if to clear it. “How are you?” he asks Peeta. “Do you think you can move on?”<br/>“No, he has to rest,” I say. My nose is running like crazy and I don’t even have a shred of fabric to use as a handkerchief. Mags rips off a handful of hanging moss from a tree limb and gives it to me. I’m too much of a mess to even question it. I blow my nose loudly and mop the tears off my face. It’s nice, the moss. Absorbent and surprisingly soft</td>

<td>So you want to make camp here, then?” Finnick asks.<br/>“I don’t think that’s an option,” Peeta answers. “Staying here. With no water. No protection. I feel all right, really. If we could just go slowly.”<br/>“Slowly would be better than not at all.” Finnick helps Peeta to his feet while I pull myself together. Since I got up this morning I’ve watched Cinna beaten to a pulp, landed in another arena, and seen Peeta die. Still, I’m glad Finnick keeps playing the pregnancy card for me, because from a sponsor’s point of view, I’m not handling things all that well.<br/>I check over my weapons, which I know are in perfect condition, because it makes me seem more in control. “I’ll take the lead,” I announce.<br/>Peeta starts to object but Finnick cuts him off. “No, let her do it.” He frowns at me. “You knew that force field was there, didn’t you? Right at the last second? You started to give a warning.” I nod. “How did you know?”<br/>I hesitate. To reveal that I know Beetee and Wiress’s trick of recognizing a force field could be dangerous. I don’t know if the Gamemakers made note of that moment during training when the two pointed it out to me or not. One way or the other, I have a very valuable piece of information. And if they know I have it, they might do something to alter the force field so I can’t see the aberration anymore. So I lie. “I don’t know. It’s almost as if I could hear it. Listen.” We all become still. There’s the sound of insects, birds, the breeze in the foliage.<br/>“I don’t hear anything,” says Peeta.<br/>“Yes,” I insist, “it’s like when the fence around District Twelve is on, only much, much quieter.” Everyone listens again intently. I do, too, although there’s nothing to hear. “There!” I say. “Can’t you hear it? It’s coming from right where Peeta got shocked.”<br/>“I don’t hear it, either,” says Finnick. “But if you do, by all means, take the lead.”<br/>I decide to play this for all it’s worth. “That’s weird,” I say. I turn my head from side to side as if puzzled. “I can only hear it out of my left ear.”<br/>“The one the doctors reconstructed?” asks Peeta.<br/>“Yeah,” I say, then give a shrug. “Maybe they did a better job than they thought. You know, sometimes I do hear funny things on that side. Things you wouldn’t ordinarily think have a sound. Like insect wings. Or snow hitting the ground.” Perfect. Now all the attention will turn to the surgeons who fixed my deaf ear after the Games last year, and they’ll have to explain why I can hear like a bat.<br/>“You,” says Mags, nudging</td>

It could be poisonous.”<br/>She mumbles something and ignores me, licking her lips with apparent relish. I look to Finnick for help but he just laughs. “I guess we’ll find out,” he says.<br/>I go forward, wondering about Finnick, who saved old Mags but will let her eat strange nuts. Who Haymitch has stamped with his seal of approval. Who brought Peeta back from the dead. Why didn’t he just let him die? He would have been blameless. I never would have guessed it was in his power to revive him. Why could he possibly have wanted to save Peeta? And why was he so determined to team up with me? Willing to kill me, too, if it comes to that. But leaving the choice of if we fight to me.</td>

<td> to the left. In fact, the force field seems to be herding us along a curved path. I stop and look back at Mags’s limping form, the sheen of sweat on Peeta’s face. “Let’s take a break,” I say. “I need to get another look from above.”<br/>The tree I choose seems to jut higher into the air than the others. I make my way up the twisting boughs, staying as close to the trunk as possible. No telling how easily these rubbery branches will snap. Still I climb beyond good sense because there’s something I have to see. As I cling to a stretch of trunk no wider than a sapling, swaying back and forth in the humid breeze, my suspicions are confirmed. There’s a reason we can’t turn to the left, will never be able to. From this precarious vantage point, I can see the shape of the whole arena for the first time. A perfect circle. With a perfect wheel in the middle. The sky above the circumference of the jungle is tinged a uniform pink. And I think I can make out one or two of those wavy squares, chinks in the armor, Wiress and Beetee called them, because they reveal what was meant to be hidden and are therefore a weakness. Just to make absolutely sure, I shoot an arrow into the empty space above the tree line. There’s a spurt of light, a flash of real blue sky, and the arrow’s thrown back into the jungle. I climb down to give the others the bad news.<br/>“The force field has us trapped in a circle. A dome, really. I don’t know how high it goes. There’s the Cornucopia, the sea, and then the jungle all around. Very exact. Very symmetrical. And not very large,” I say.<br/>“Did you see any water?” asks Finnick.<br/>“Only the saltwater where we started the Games,” I say.<br/>“There must be some other source,” says Peeta, frowning. “Or we’ll all be dead in a matter of days.”<br/>“Well, the foliage is thick. Maybe there are ponds or springs somewhere,” I say doubtfully. I instinctively feel the Capitol might want these unpopular Games over as soon as possible. Plutarch Heavensbee might have already been given orders to knock us off. “At any rate, there’s no point in trying to find out what’s over the edge of this hill, because the answer is nothing.”<br/>“There must be drinkable water between the force field and the wheel,” Peeta insists. We all know what this means. Heading back down. Heading back to the Careers and the bloodshed. With Mags hardly able to walk and Peeta too weak to fight.</td>

<td>When I arrive, I see the others have transformed the place. Mags and Finnick have created a hut of sorts out of the grass mats, open on one side but with three walls, a floor, and a roof. Mags has also plaited several bowls that Peeta has filled with roasted nuts. Their faces turn to me hopefully, but I give my head a shake. “No. No water. It’s out there, though. He knew where it was,” I say, hoisting the skinned rodent up for all to see. “He’d been drinking recently when I shot him out of a tree, but I couldn’t find his source. I swear, I covered every inch of ground in a thirty-yard radius.”<br/>“Can we eat him?” Peeta asks.<br/>“I don’t know for sure. But his meat doesn’t look that different from a squirrel’s. He ought to be cooked…” I hesitate as I think of trying to start a fire out here from complete scratch. Even if I succeed, there’s the smoke to think about. We’re all so close together in this arena, there’s no chance of hiding it.<br/>Peeta has another idea. He takes a cube of rodent meat, skewers it on the tip of a pointed stick, and lets it fall into the force field. There’s a sharp sizzle and the stick flies back. The chunk of meat is blackened on the outside but well cooked inside. We give him a round of applause, then quickly stop, remembering where we are.<br/>The white sun sinks in the rosy sky as we gather in the hut. I’m still leery about the nuts, but Finnick says Mags recognized them from another Games. I didn’t bother spending time at the edible-plants station in training because it was so effortless for me last year. Now I wish I had. For surely there would have been some of the unfamiliar plants surrounding me. And I might have guessed a bit more about where I was headed. Mags seems fine, though, and she’s been eating the nuts for hours. So I pick one up and take a small bite. It has a mild, slightly sweet flavor that reminds me of a chestnut. I decide it’s all right. The rodent’s strong and gamey but surprisingly juicy. Really, it’s not a bad meal for our first night in the arena. If only we had something to wash it down with.<br/>Finnick asks a lot of questions about the rodent, which we decide to call a tree rat. How high was it, how long did I watch it before I shot, and what was it doing? I don’t remember</td>

But it turns out to be plenty hard for me as well. Seeing the faces of the eight dead victors projected into the sky.<br/>The man from District 5, the one Finnick took out with his trident, is the first to appear. That means that all the tributes in 1 through 4 are alive—the four Careers, Beetee and Wiress, and, of course, Mags and Finnick. The man from District 5 is followed by the male morphling from 6, Cecelia and Woof from 8, both from 9, the woman from 10, and Seeder from 11. The Capitol seal is back with a final bit of music and then the sky goes dark except for the moon.<br/>No one speaks. I can’t pretend I knew any of them well. But I’m thinking of those three kids hanging on to Cecelia when they took her away. Seeder’s kindness to me at our meeting.

<td>Peeta unties the cord and flattens out the circle of silk. On the parachute sits a small metal object that I can’t place. “What is it?” I ask. No one knows. We pass it from hand to hand, taking turns examining it. It’s a hollow metal tube, tapered slightly at one end. On the other end a small lip curves downward. It’s vaguely familiar. A part that could have fallen off a bicycle, a curtain rod, anything, really.<br/>Peeta blows on one end to see if it makes a sound. It doesn’t. Finnick slides his pinkie into it, testing it out as a weapon. Useless.<br/>“Can you fish with it, Mags?” I ask. Mags, who can fish with almost anything, shakes her head and grunts.<br/>I take it and roll it back and forth on my palm. Since we’re allies, Haymitch will be working with the District 4 mentors. He had a hand in choosing this gift. That means it’s valuable. Lifesaving, even. I think back to last year, when I wanted water so badly, but he wouldn’t send it because he knew I could find it if I tried. Haymitch’s gifts, or lack thereof, carry weighty messages. I can almost hear him growling at me, Use your brain if you have one. What is it?<br/>I wipe the sweat from my eyes and hold the gift out in the moonlight. I move it this way and that, viewing it from different angles, covering portions and then revealing them. Trying to make it divulge its purpose to me. Finally, in frustration, I jam one end into the dirt. “I give up. Maybe if we hook up with Beetee or Wiress they can figure it out.”<br/>I stretch out, pressing my hot cheek on the grass mat, staring at the thing in aggravation. Peeta rubs a tense spot between my shoulders and I let myself relax a little. I wonder why this place hasn’t cooled off at all now that the sun’s gone down. I wonder what’s going on back home.<br/>Prim. My mother. Gale. Madge. I think of them watching me from home. At least I hope they’re at home. Not taken into custody by Thread. Being punished as Cinna is. As Darius is. Punished because of me. Everybody.<br/>I begin to ache for them, for my district, for my woods. A decent woods with sturdy hardwood trees, plentiful food, game that isn’t creepy. Rushing streams. Cool breezes. No, cold winds to blow this stifling heat away. I conjure up such a wind in my mind, letting it freeze my cheeks and numb my fingers, and all at once, the piece of metal half buried in the black earth has a name.<br/>“A spile!” I exclaim, sitting bolt upright.<br/>“What?” asks Finnick.<br/>I wrestle the thing from the ground and brush it clean. Cup my hand around the tapered end, concealing it, and look at the lip. Yes, I’ve seen one of these before. On a cold, windy day long ago, when I was out in the woods with my father. Inserted snugly into a hole drilled in the side of a maple. A pathway for the sap to follow as it flowed into our bucket. Maple syrup could make even our dull bread a treat. After my father died, I didn’t know what happened to the handful of spiles he had. Hidden out in the woods somewhere, probably. Never to be found.<br/>“It’s a spile. Sort of like a faucet. You put it in a tree and sap comes out.” I look at the sinewy green trunks around me. “Well, the right sort of tree.”<br/>“Sap?” asks Finnick. They don’t have the right kind of trees by the sea, either.<br/>“To make syrup,” says Peeta. “But there must be something else inside these trees.”<br/>We’re all on our feet at once. Our thirst. The lack of springs. The tree rat’s sharp front teeth and wet muzzle. There can only be one thing worth having inside these trees. Finnick goes to hammer the spile into the green bark of a massive tree with a rock, but I stop him. “Wait. You might damage it. We need to drill a hole first,” I say.<br/>There’s nothing to drill with, so Mags offers her awl and Peeta drives it straight into the bark, burying the spike two inches deep. He and Finnick take turns opening up the hole with the awl and the knives until it can hold the spile. I wedge it in carefully and we all stand back in anticipation. At first nothing happens. Then a drop of water rolls down the lip and lands in Mags’s palm. She licks it off and holds out her hand for more.<br/>By wiggling and adjusting the spile, we get a thin stream running out. We take turns holding our mouths under the tap, wetting our parched tongues. Mags brings over a basket, and the grass is so tightly woven it holds water. We fill the basket and pass it around, taking deep gulps and, later, luxuriously, splashing our faces clean. Like everything here, the water’s on the warm side, but this is no time to be picky.<br/>Without our thirst to distract us, we’re </td>

<td>Some kind of fog. Poisonous gas. Hurry, Peeta!” I urge. I can tell that however much he denied it during the day, the aftereffects of hitting the force field have been significant. He’s slow, much slower than usual. And the tangle of vines and undergrowth, which unbalance me occasionally, trip him at every step.<br/>I look back at the wall of fog extending in a straight line as far as I can see in either direction. A terrible impulse to flee, to abandon Peeta and save myself, shoots through me. It would be so simple, to run full out, perhaps to even climb a tree above the fog line, which seems to top out at about forty feet. I remember how I did just this when the muttations appeared in the last Games. Took off and only thought of Peeta when I’d reached the Cornucopia. But this time, I trap my terror, push it down, and stay by his side. This time my survival isn’t the goal. Peeta’s is. I think of the eyes glued to the television screens in the districts, seeing if I will run, as the Capitol wishes, or hold my ground.<br/>I lock my fingers tightly into his and say, “Watch my feet. Just try to step where I step.” It helps. We seem to move a little faster, but never enough to afford a rest, and the mist continues to lap at our heels. Droplets spring free of the body of vapor. They burn, but not like fire. Less a sense of heat and more of intense pain as the chemicals find our flesh, cling to it, and burrow down through the layers of skin. Our jumpsuits are no help at all. We may as well be dressed in tissue paper, for all the protection they give.</td>

<td>On the fog comes, silent and steady and flat, except for the grasping tendrils. Although my instinct is to run directly away from it, I realize Finnick is moving at a diagonal down the hill. He’s trying to keep a distance from the gas while steering us toward the water that surrounds the Cornucopia. Yes, water, I think as the acid droplets bore deeper into me. Now I’m so thankful I didn’t kill Finnick, because how would I have gotten Peeta out of here alive? So thankful to have someone else on my side, even if it’s only temporarily.<br/>It’s not Mags’s</td>

<td>I can see Finnick’s eyes, green in the moonlight. I can see them as clear as day. Almost like a cat’s, with a strange reflective quality. Maybe because they are shiny with tears. “No,” he says. “I can’t carry them both. My arms aren’t working.” It’s true. His arms jerk uncontrollably at his sides. His hands are empty. Of his three tridents, only one remains, and it’s in Peeta’s hands. “I’m sorry, Mags. I can’t do it.”<br/>What happens next is so fast, so senseless, I can’t even move to stop it. Mags hauls herself up, plants a kiss on Finnick’s lips, and then hobbles straight into the fog. Immediately, her body is seized by wild contortions and she falls to the ground in a horrible dance.<br/>I want to scream, but my throat is on fire. I take one futile step in her direction when I hear the cannon blast, know her heart has stopped, that she is dead. “Finnick?” I call out hoarsely, but he has already turned from the scene, already continued his retreat from the fog. Dragging my useless leg behind me, I stagger after him, having no idea what else to do.<br/>Time and space lose meaning as the fog seems to invade my brain, muddling my thoughts, making everything unreal. Some deep-rooted animal desire for survival keeps me stumbling after Finnick and Peeta, continuing to move, although I’m probably dead already. Parts of me are dead, or clearly dying. And Mags is dead. This is something I know, or maybe just think I know, because it makes no sense at all.</td>

<td> My shoes and undergarments are inexplicably unaffected. Little by little, one small portion of a limb at a time, I soak the poison out of my wounds. Peeta seems to be doing the same. But Finnick backed away from the water at first touch and lies facedown on the sand, either unwilling or unable to purge himself.<br/>Finally, when I have survived the worst, opening my eyes underwater, sniffing water into my sinuses and snorting it out, and even gargling repeatedly to wash out my throat, I’m functional enough to help Finnick. Some feeling has returned to my leg, but my arms are still riddled with spasms. I can’t drag Finnick into the water, and possibly the pain would kill him, anyway. So I scoop up shaky handfuls and empty them on his fists. Since he’s not underwater, the poison comes out of his wounds just as it went in, in wisps of fog that I take great care to steer clear of. Peeta recovers enough to help me. He cuts away Finnick’s jumpsuit. Somewhere he finds two shells that work much better than our hands do. We concentrate on soaking Finnick’s arms first, since they have been so badly damaged, and even though a lot of white stuff pours out of them, he doesn’t notice. He just lies there, eyes shut, giving an occasional moan.<br/></td>

<td>about ten minutes with everything immersed from the neck down. Peeta and I exchange a smile as Finnick lifts his arms above the seawater.<br/>“There’s just your head left, Finnick. That’s the worst part, but you’ll feel much better after, if you can bear it,” Peeta says. We help him to sit up and let him grip our hands as he purges his eyes and nose and mouth. His throat is still too raw to speak.<br/>“I’m going to try to tap a tree,” I say. My fingers fumble at my belt and find the spile still hanging from its vine.<br/>“Let me make the hole first,” says Peeta. “You stay with him. You’re the healer.”<br/>That’s a joke, I think. But I don’t say it out loud, since Finnick has enough to deal with. He got the worst of the fog, although I’m not sure why. Maybe because he’s the biggest or maybe because he had to exert himself the most. And then, of course, there’s Mags. I still don’t understand what happened there. Why he essentially abandoned her to carry Peeta. Why she not only didn’t question it, but ran straight to her death without a moment’s hesitation. Was it because she was so old that her days were numbered, anyway? Did they think that Finnick would stand a better chance of winning if he had Peeta and me as allies? The haggard look on Finnick’s face tells me that now is not the moment to ask.<br/>Instead I try to put myself</td>

<td>dropped it or taken it into the fog with her. Anyway, it’s gone.<br/>I have moved out a bit farther into the shallows, floating alternately on my belly and back. If the seawater healed Peeta and me, it seems to be transforming Finnick altogether. He begins to move slowly, just testing his limbs, and gradually begins to swim. But it’s not like me swimming, the rhythmic strokes, the even pace. It’s like watching some strange sea animal coming back to life. He dives and surfaces, spraying water out of his mouth, rolls over and over in some bizarre corkscrew motion that makes me dizzy even to watch. And then, when he’s been underwater so long I feel certain he’s drowned, his head pops up right next to me and I start.<br/>“Don’t do that,” I say.<br/>“What? Come up or stay under?” he says.<br/>“Either. Neither. Whatever. Just soak in the water and behave,” I say. “Or if you feel this good, let’s go help Peeta.”<br/></td>

<td>I’ve never seen any animal move so fast. They slide down the vines as if the things were greased. Leap impossible distances from tree to tree. Fangs bared, hackles raised, claws shooting out like switchblades. I may be unfamiliar with monkeys, but animals in nature don’t act like this. “Mutts!” I spit out as Finnick and I crash into the greenery.<br/>I know every arrow must count, and they do. In the eerie light, I bring down monkey after monkey, targeting eyes and hearts and throats, so that each hit means a death. But still it wouldn’t be enough without Finnick spearing the beasts like fish and flinging them aside, Peeta slashing away with his knife. I feel claws on my leg, down my back, before someone takes out the attacker. The air grows heavy with trampled plants, the scent of blood, and the musty stink of the monkeys. Peeta and Finnick and I position ourselves in a triangle, a few yards apart, our backs to one another. My heart sinks as my fingers draw back my last arrow. Then I remember Peeta has a sheath, too. And he’s not shooting, he’s hacking away with that knife. My own knife is out now, but the monkeys are quicker, can spring in and out so fast you can barely react.<br/>“Peeta!” I shout. “Your arrows!”<br/>Peeta turns to see my predicament and is sliding off his sheath when it happens. A monkey lunges out of a tree for his chest. I have no arrow, no way to shoot. I can hear the thud of Finnick’s trident finding another mark and know his weapon is occupied. Peeta’s knife arm is disabled as he tries to remove the sheath. I throw my knife at the oncoming mutt but the creature somersaults, evading the blade, and stays on its trajectory.<br/>Weaponless, defenseless, I do the only thing I can think of. I run for Peeta, to knock him to the ground, to protect his body with mine, even though I know I won’t make it in time.<br/>She does, though. Materializing, it seems, from thin air. One moment nowhere, the next reeling in front of Peeta. Already bloody, mouth open in a high-pitched scream, pupils enlarged so her eyes seem like black holes.<br/>The insane morphling from District 6 throws up her skeletal arms as if to embrace the monkey, and it sinks its fangs into her chest.</td>

<td>She lies on the sand, gasping like a fish out of water. Sagging skin, sickly green, her ribs as prominent as a child’s dead of starvation. Surely she could afford food, but turned to the morphling just as Haymitch turned to drink, I guess. Everything about her speaks of waste—her body, her life, the vacant look in her eyes. I hold one of her twitching hands, unclear whether it moves from the poison that affected our nerves, the shock of the attack, or withdrawal from the drug that was her sustenance. There is nothing we can do. Nothing but stay with her while she dies.<br/>“I’ll watch the trees,” Finnick says before walking away. I’d like to walk away, too, but she grips my hand so tightly I would have to pry off her fingers, and I don’t have the strength for that kind of cruelty. I think of Rue, how maybe I could sing a song or something. But I don’t even know the morphling’s name, let alone if she likes songs. I just know she’s dying.<br/>Peeta crouches down on the other side of her and strokes her hair. When he begins to speak in a soft voice, it seems almost nonsensical, but the words aren’t for me. “With my paint box at home, I can make every color imaginable. Pink. As pale as a baby’s skin. Or as deep as rhubarb. Green like spring grass. Blue that shimmers like ice on water.”<br/>The morphling stares into Peeta’s eyes, hanging on to his words.<br/>“One time, I spent three days mixing paint until I found the right shade for sunlight on white fur. You see, I kept thinking it was yellow, but it was much more than that. Layers of all sorts of color. One by one,” says Peeta.<br/>The morphling’s breathing is slowing into shallow catch-breaths. Her free hand dabbles in the blood on her chest, making the tiny swirling motions she so loved to paint with.<br/>“I haven’t figured out a rainbow yet. They come so quickly and leave so soon. I never have enough time to capture them. Just a bit of blue here or purple there. And then they fade away again. Back into the air,” says Peeta.<br/>The morphling seems mesmerized by Peeta’s words. Entranced. She lifts up a trembling hand and paints what I think might be a flower on Peeta’s cheek.<br/>“Thank you,” he whispers. “That looks beautiful.”<br/>For a moment, the morphling’s face lights up in a grin and she makes a small squeaking sound. Then her blooddappled hand falls back onto her chest, she gives one last huff of air, and the cannon fires. The grip on my hand releases.<br/>Peeta carries her out into the water. He returns and sits beside me. The morphling floats out toward the Cornucopia for a while, then the hovercraft appears and a four-pronged claw drops, encases her, carries her into the night sky, and she’s gone.<br/>Finnick rejoins us, his fist full of my arrows still wet with monkey blood. He drops them beside me on the sand. “Thought you might want these.”<br/>“Thanks,” I say. I wade into the water and wash off the gore, from my weapons, my wounds. By the time I return to the jungle to gather some moss to dry them, all the monkeys’ bodies have vanished.</td>

<td>It’s still night, though dawn can’t be too many hours away. Unless the Gamemakers want it to be. “Why don’t you two get some rest?” I say. “I’ll watch for a while.”<br/>“No, Katniss, I’d rather,” says Finnick. I look in his eyes, at his face, and realize he’s barely holding back tears. Mags. The least I can do is give him the privacy to mourn her.<br/>“All right, Finnick, thanks,” I say. I lie down on the sand with Peeta, who drifts off at once. I stare into the night, thinking of what a difference a day makes. How yesterday morning, Finnick was on my kill list, and now I’m willing to sleep with him as my guard. He saved Peeta and let Mags die and I don’t know why. Only that I can never settle the balance owed between us. All I can do at the moment is go to sleep and let him grieve in peace. And so I do.<br/>It’s midmorning when I open my eyes again. Peeta’s still out beside me. Above us, a mat of grass suspended on branches shields our faces from the sunlight. I sit up and see that Finnick’s hands have not been idle. Two woven bowls are filled with fresh water. A third holds a mess of shellfish.<br/>Finnick sits on the sand, cracking them open with a stone. “They’re better fresh,” he says, ripping a chunk of flesh from a shell and popping it into his mouth. His eyes are still puffy but I pretend not to notice.<br/>My stomach begins to growl at the smell of food and I reach for one. The sight of my fingernails, caked with blood, stops me. I’ve been scratching my skin raw in my sleep.</td>

<td>You know, if you scratch you’ll bring on infection,” says Finnick.<br/>“That’s what I’ve heard,” I say. I go into the saltwater and wash off the blood, trying to decide which I hate more, pain or itching. Fed up, I stomp back onto the beach, turn my face upward, and snap, “Hey, Haymitch, if you’re not too drunk, we could use a little something for our skin.”<br/>It’s almost funny how quickly the parachute appears above me. I reach up and the tube lands squarely in my open hand. “About time,” I say, but I can’t keep the scowl on my face. Haymitch. What I wouldn’t give for five minutes of conversation with him.<br/>I plunk down on the sand next to Finnick and screw the lid off the tube. Inside is a thick, dark ointment with a pungent smell, a combination of tar and pine needles. I wrinkle my nose as I squeeze a glob of the medicine onto my palm and begin to massage it into my leg. A sound of pleasure slips out of my mouth as the stuff eradicates my itching. It also stains my scabby skin a ghastly gray-green. As I start on the second leg I toss the tube to Finnick, who eyes me doubtfully.<br/>“It’s like you’re decomposing,” says Finnick. But I guess the itching wins out, because after a minute Finnick begins to treat his own skin, too. Really, the combination of the scabs and the ointment looks hideous. I can’t help enjoying his distress.<br/>“Poor Finnick. Is this the first time in your life you haven’t looked pretty?” I say.<br/>“It must be. The sensation’s completely new. How have you managed it all these years?” he asks.<br/>“Just avoid mirrors. You’ll forget about it,” I say.<br/>“Not if I keep looking at you,” he says.<br/>We slather ourselves down, even taking turns rubbing the ointment into each other’s backs where the undershirts don’t protect our skin. “I’m going to wake Peeta,” I say.<br/>“No, wait,” says Finnick. “Let’s do it together. Put our faces right in front of his.”<br/>Well, there’s so little opportunity for fun left in my life, I agree. We position ourselves on either side of Peeta, lean over until our faces are inches from his nose, and give him a shake. “Peeta. Peeta, wake up,” I say in a soft, singsong voice.<br/>His eyelids flutter open and then he jumps like we’ve stabbed him. “Aa!”<br/>Finnick and I fall back in the sand, laughing our heads off. Every time we try to stop, we look at Peeta’s attempt to maintain a disdainful expression and it sets us off again. By the time we pull ourselves together, I’m thinking that maybe Finnick Odair is all right. At least not as vain or self-important as I’d thought. Not so bad at all, really. And just as I’ve come to this conclusion, a parachute lands next to us with a fresh loaf of bread. Remembering from last year how Haymitch’s gifts are often timed to send a message, I make a note to myself. Be friends with Finnick. You’ll get food.<br/>Finnick turns the bread over in his hands, examining the crust. A bit too possessively. It’s not necessary. It’s got that green tint from seaweed that the bread from District 4 always has. We all know it’s his. Maybe he’s just realized how precious it is, and that he may never see another loaf again. Maybe some memory of Mags is associated with the crust. But all he says is, “This will go well with the shellfish.”<br/>While I help Peeta coat his skin with the ointment, Finnick deftly cleans the meat from the shellfish. We gather round and eat the delicious sweet flesh with the salty bread from District 4.<br/></td>

<td>The circle of water slowly calms down, having absorbed the giant wave. We rearrange our things back on the wet sand and are about to settle down when I see them. Three figures, about two spokes away, stumbling onto the beach. “There,” I say quietly, nodding in the newcomers’ direction. Peeta and Finnick follow my gaze. As if by previous agreement, we all fade back into the shadows of the jungle.<br/>The trio’s in bad shape—you can see that right off. One is being practically dragged out by a second, and the third wanders in loopy circles, as if deranged. They’re a solid brick-red color, as if they’ve been dipped in paint and left out to dry.<br/>“Who is that?” asks Peeta. “Or what? Muttations?”<br/>I draw back an arrow, readying for an attack. But all that happens is that the one who was being dragged collapses on the beach. The dragger stamps the ground in frustration and, in an apparent fit of temper, turns and shoves the circling, deranged one over.<br/>Finnick’s face lights up. “Johanna!” he calls, and runs for the red things.<br/>“Finnick!” I hear Johanna’s voice reply.<br/>I exchange a look with Peeta. “What now?” I ask.<br/>“We can’t really leave Finnick,” he says.<br/>“Guess not. Come on, then,” I say grouchily, because even if I’d had a list of allies, Johanna Mason would definitely not have been on it. The two of us tromp down the beach to where Finnick and Johanna are just meeting up. As we move in closer, I see her companions, and confusion sets in. That’s Beetee on the ground on his back and Wiress who’s regained her feet to continue making loops. “She’s got Wiress and Beetee.”<br/>“Nuts and Volts?” says Peeta, equally puzzled. “I’ve got to hear how this happened.”<br/>When we reach them, Johanna’s gesturing toward the jungle and talking very fast to Finnick. “We thought it was rain, you know, because of the lightning, and we were all so thirsty. But when it started coming down, it turned out to be blood. Thick, hot blood. You couldn’t see, you couldn’t speak without getting a mouthful. We just staggered around, trying to get out of it. That’s when Blight hit the force field.”<br/>“I’m sorry, Johanna,” says Finnick. It takes a moment to place Blight. I think he was Johanna’s male counterpart from District 7, but I hardly remember seeing him. Come to think of it, I don’t even think he showed up for training.<br/>“Yeah, well, he wasn’t much, but he was from home,” she says. “And he left me alone with these two.” She nudges Beetee, who’s barely conscious, with her shoe. “He got a knife in the back at the Cornucopia. And her</td>

She steps forward before I can react and slaps me so hard I see stars. “Who do you think got them out of that bleeding jungle for you? You—” Finnick tosses her writhing body over his shoulder and carries her out into the water and repeatedly dunks her while she screams a lot of really insulting things at me. But I don’t shoot. Because she’s with Finnick and because of what she said, about getting them for me.<br/>“What did she mean? She got them for me?” I ask Peeta.<br/>“I don’t know. You did want them originally,” he reminds me.<br/>“Yeah, I did. Originally.” But that answers nothing. I look down at Beetee’s inert body. “But I won’t have them long unless we do something.”<br/></td>

<td>There’s no choice but to strip him naked to get him clean, but I have to say this doesn’t make much of an impression on me anymore. Our kitchen table’s been full of so many naked men this year. You kind of get used to it after a while.<br/>We put down Finnick’s mat and lay Beetee on his stomach so we can examine his back. There’s a gash about six inches long running from his shoulder blade to below his ribs. Fortunately it’s not too deep. He’s lost a lot of blood, though—you can tell by the pallor of his skin—and it’s still oozing out of the wound.<br/>I sit back on my heels, trying to think. What do I have to work with? Seawater? I feel like my mother when her first line of defense for treating everything was snow. I look over at the jungle. I bet there’s a whole pharmacy in there if I knew how to use it. But these aren’t my plants. Then I think about the moss Mags gave me to blow my nose. “Be right back,” I tell Peeta. Fortunately the stuff seems to be pretty common in the jungle. I rip an armful from the nearby trees and carry it back to the beach. I make a thick pad out of the moss, place it on Beetee’s cut, and secure it by tying vines around his body. We get some water into him and then pull him into the shade at the edge of the jungle.<br/>“I think that’s all we can do,” I say.<br/>“It’s good. You’re good with this healing stuff,” he says. “It’s in your blood.”<br/>“No,” I say, shaking my head. “I got my father’s blood.” The kind that quickens during a hunt, not an epidemic. “I’m going to see about Wiress.”<br/></td>

<td>The sun rises in the sky until it’s directly over us. It must be noon, I think absently. Not that it matters. Across the water, off to the right, I see the enormous flash as the lightning bolt hits the tree and the electrical storm begins again. Right in the same area it did last night. Someone must have moved into its range, triggered the attack. I sit for a while watching the lightning, keeping Wiress calm, lulled into a sort of peacefulness by the lapping of the water. I think of last night, how the lightning began just after the bell tolled. Twelve bongs.<br/>“Tick, tock,” Wiress says, surfacing to consciousness for a moment and then going back under.<br/>Twelve bongs last night. Like it was midnight. Then lightning. The sun overhead now. Like it’s noon. And lightning.<br/>Slowly I rise up and survey the arena. The lightning there. In the next pie wedge over came the blood rain, where Johanna, Wiress, and Beetee were caught. We would have been in the third section, right next to that, when the fog appeared. And as soon as it was sucked away, the monkeys began to gather in the fourth. Tick, tock. My head snaps to the other side. A couple of hours ago, at around ten, that wave came out of the second section to the left of where the lightning strikes now. At noon. At midnight. At noon.<br/>“Tick, tock,” Wiress says in her sleep. As the lightning ceases and the blood rain begins just to the right of it, her words suddenly make sense.<br/>“Oh,” I say under my breath. “Tick, tock.” My eyes sweep around the full circle of the arena and I know she’s right. “Tick, tock. This is a clock.”</td>

I see a clock. No, it’s a watch, resting in Plutarch Heavensbee’s palm. “It starts at midnight,” Plutarch said. And then my mockingjay lit up briefly and vanished. In retrospect, it’s like he was giving me a clue about the arena. But why would he? At the time, I was no more a tribute in these Games than he was. Maybe he thought it would help me as a mentor.

She crouches beside him and he puts the coil of wire in her hands. “Clean it, will you?” he asks.<br/>Wiress nods and scampers over to the water’s edge, where she dunks the coil in the water. She starts quietly singing some funny little song, about a mouse running up a clock. It must be for children, but it seems to make her happy.<br/>“Oh, not the song again,” says Johanna, rolling her eyes. “That went on for hours before she started tick-tocking.”<br/>Suddenly Wiress stands up very straight and points to the jungle. “Two,” she says.<br/>I follow her finger to where the wall of fog has just begun to seep out onto the beach. “Yes, look, Wiress is right.

Like a canary in one of your coal mines.”<br/>“What’s that?” Finnick asks me.<br/>“It’s a bird that we take down into the mines to warn us if there’s bad air,” I say.<br/>“What’s it do, die?” asks Johanna.<br/>“It stops singing first. That’s when you should get out. But if the air’s too bad, it dies, yes. And so do you.” I don’t want to talk about dying songbirds. They bring up thoughts of my father’s death and Rue’s death and Maysilee Donner’s death and my mother inheriting her songbird. Oh, great, and now I’m thinking of Gale, deep down in that horrible mine, with President Snow’s threat hanging over his head. So easy to make it look like an accident down there. A silent canary, a spark, and nothing more.<br/>I go back to imagining killing the president.</td>

<td>Despite her annoyance at Wiress, Johanna’s as happy as I’ve seen her in the arena. While I’m adding to my stock of arrows, she pokes around until she comes up with a pair of lethal-looking axes. It seems an odd choice until I see her throw one with such force it sticks in the sunsoftened gold of the Cornucopia. Of course. Johanna Mason. District 7. Lumber. I bet she’s been tossing around axes since she could toddle. It’s like Finnick with his trident. Or Beetee with his wire. Rue with her knowledge of plants. I realize it’s just another disadvantage the District 12 tributes have faced over the years. We don’t go down in the mines until we’re eighteen. It looks like most of the other tributes learn something about their trades early on. There are things you do in a mine that could come in handy in the Games. Wielding a pick. Blowing things up. Give you an edge. The way my hunting did. But we learn them too late.</td>

Then he sits back. “Well, it’s a lot more than we knew this morning, anyway.”<br/>We all nod in agreement, and that’s when I notice it. The silence. Our canary has stopped singing.<br/>I don’t wait. I load an arrow as I twist and get a glimpse of a dripping-wet Gloss letting Wiress slide to the ground, her throat slit open in a bright red smile. The point of my arrow disappears into his right temple, and in the instant it takes to reload, Johanna has buried an ax blade in Cashmere’s chest. Finnick knocks away a spear Brutus throws at Peeta and takes Enobaria’s knife in his thigh. If there wasn’t a Cornucopia to duck behind, they’d be dead, both of the tributes from District 2. I spring forward in pursuit. Boom! Boom! Boom! The cannon confirms there’s no way to help Wiress, no need to finish off Gloss or Cashmere. My allies and I are rounding the horn, starting to give chase to Brutus and Enobaria, who are sprinting down a sand strip toward the jungle</td>

Finnick reviving Peeta after the force field stopped his heart. Mags running into the fog so that Finnick could carry Peeta. The morphling hurling herself in front of him to block the monkey’s attack. The fight with the Careers was so quick, but didn’t Finnick block Brutus’s spear from hitting Peeta even though it meant taking Enobaria’s knife in his leg?

What has Haymitch possibly said to them, what has he bargained with to make them put Peeta’s life above their own?<br/>I know my own reasons for keeping Peeta alive. He’s my friend, and this is my way to defy the Capitol, to subvert its terrible Games. But if I had no real ties to him, what would make me want to save him, to choose him over myself? Certainly he is brave, but we have all been brave enough to survive a Games. There is that quality of goodness that’s hard to overlook, but still…and then I think of it, what Peeta can do so much better than the rest of us. He can use words. He obliterated the rest of the field at both interviews. And maybe it’s because of that underlying goodness that he can move a crowd—no, a country—to his side with the turn of a simple sentence.<br/>I remember thinking that was the gift the leader of our revolution should have. Has Haymitch convinced the others of this? That Peeta’s tongue would have far greater power against the Capitol than any physical strength the rest of us could claim? I don’t know. It still seems like a really long leap for some of the tributes. I mean, we’re talking about Johanna Mason here.

<td>Where is she? What are they doing to her? “Prim!” I cry out. “Prim!” Only another agonized scream answers me. How did she get here? Why is she part of the Games? “Prim!”<br/>Vines cut into my face and arms, creepers grab my feet. But I am getting closer to her. Closer. Very close now. Sweat pours down my face, stinging the healing acid wounds. I pant, trying to get some use out of the warm, moist air that seems empty of oxygen. Prim makes a sound—such a lost, irretrievable sound—that I can’t even imagine what they have done to evoke it.<br/>“Prim!” I rip through a wall of green into a small clearing and the sound repeats directly above me. Above me? My head whips back. Do they have her up in the trees? I desperately search the branches but see nothing. “Prim?” I say pleadingly. I hear her but can’t see her. Her next wail rings out, clear as a bell, and there’s no mistaking the source. It’s coming from the mouth of a small, crested black bird perched on a branch about ten feet over my head. And then I understand.<br/>It’s a jabberjay.<br/>I’ve never seen one before—I thought they no longer existed—and for a moment, as I lean against the trunk of the tree, clutching the stitch in my side, I examine it. The muttation, the forerunner, the father. I pull up a mental image of a mockingbird, fuse it with the jabberjay, and yes, I can see how they mated to make my mockingjay. There is nothing about the bird that suggests it’s a mutt. Nothing except the horribly lifelike sounds of Prim’s voice streaming from its mouth. I silence it with an arrow in its throat. The bird falls to the ground. I remove my arrow and wring its neck for good measure. Then I hurl the revolting thing into the jungle. No degree of hunger would ever tempt me to eat it.<br/>It wasn’t real, I tell myself. The same way the muttation wolves last year weren’t really the dead tributes. It’s just a sadistic trick of the Gamemakers.<br/>Finnick crashes into the clearing to find me wiping my arrow clean with some moss. “Katniss?”<br/>“It’s okay. I’m okay,” I say, although I don’t feel okay at all. “I thought I heard my sister but—” The piercing shriek cuts me off. It’s another voice, not Prim’s, maybe a young woman’s. I don’t recognize it. But the effect on Finnick is instantaneous. The color vanishes from his face and I can actually see his pupils dilate in fear. “Finnick, wait!” I say, reaching out to reassure him, but he’s bolted away. Gone off in pursuit of the victim, as mindlessly as I pursued Prim. “Finnick!” I call, but I know he won’t turn back and wait for me to give a rational explanation. So all I can do is follow him.<br/>It’s no effort to track him, even though he’s moving so fast, since he leaves a clear, trampled path in his wake. But the bird is at least a quarter mile away, most of it uphill, and by the time I reach him, I’m winded. He’s circling around a giant tree. The trunk must be four feet in diameter and the limbs don’t even begin until twenty feet up. The woman’s shrieks emanate from somewhere in the foliage, but the jabberjay’s concealed. Finnick’s screaming as well, over and over. “Annie! Annie!” He’s in a state of panic and completely unreachable, so I do what I would do anyway. I scale an adjacent tree, locate the jabberjay, and take it out with an arrow. It falls straight down, landing right at Finnick’s feet. He picks it up, slowly making the connection, but when I slide down to join him, he looks more despairing than ever.<br/>“It’s all right, Finnick. It’s just a jabberjay. They’re playing a trick on us,” I say. “It’s not real. It’s not your…Annie.”<br/>“No, it’s not Annie. But the voice was hers. Jabberjays mimic what they hear. Where did they get those screams, Katniss?” he says.<br/>I can feel my own cheeks grow pale as I understand his meaning. “Oh, Finnick, you don’t think they…”<br/>“Yes. I do. That’s exactly what I think,” he says.<br/>I have an image of Prim in a white room, strapped to a table, while masked, robed figures elicit those sounds from her. Somewhere they are torturing her, or did torture her, to get those sounds. My knees turn to water and I sink to the ground. Finnick is trying to tell me something, but I can’t hear him. What I do finally hear is another bird starting up somewhere off to my left. And this time, the voice is Gale’s.<br/>Finnick catches my arm before I can run. “No. It’s not him.” He starts pulling me downhill, toward the beach. “We’re getting out of here!” But Gale’s voice is so full of pain I can’t help struggling to reach it. “It’s not him, Katniss! It’s a mutt!” Finnick shouts at me. “Come on!” He moves me along, half dragging, half carrying me, until I can process what he said. He’s right, it’s just another jabberjay. I can’t help Gale by chasing it down. </td>

Somewhere. The jabberjay just recorded it,” I say.<br/>“No, that’s what they want you to think. The same way I wondered if Glimmer’s eyes were in that mutt last year. But those weren’t Glimmer’s eyes. And that wasn’t Prim’s voice. Or if it was, they took it from an interview or something and distorted the sound.

We’re almost down to the final eight of us. And what happens then?” Peeta says.<br/>“Seven more of us die,” I say hopelessly.<br/>“No, back home. What happens when they reach the final eight tributes in the Games?” He lifts my chin so I have to look at him. Forces me to make eye contact. “What happens? At the final eight?”<br/>I know he’s trying to help me, so I make myself think. “At the final eight?” I repeat. “They interview your family and friends back home.”<br/>“That’s right,” says Peeta. “They interview your family and friends. And can they do that if they’ve killed them all?”<br/>“No?” I ask, still unsure.<br/>“No. That’s how we know Prim’s alive. She’ll be the first one they interview, won’t she?” he asks.<br/>I want to believe him. Badly. It’s just…those voices…<br/>“First Prim. Then your mother. Your cousin, Gale. Madge,” he continues. “It was a trick, Katniss. A horrible one. But we’re the only ones who can be hurt by it. We’re the ones in the Games. Not them.”<br/>“You really believe that?” I say.<br/>“I really do,” says Peeta. I waver, thinking of how Peeta can make anyone believe anything. I look over at Finnick for confirmation, see he’s fixated on Peeta, his words.<br/>“Do you believe it, Finnick?” I ask.<br/>“It could be true. I don’t know,” he says. “Could they do that, Beetee? Take someone’s regular voice and make it…”<br/>“Oh, yes. It’s not even that difficult, Finnick. Our children learn a similar technique in school,” says Beetee.<br/>“Of course Peeta’s right. The whole country adores Katniss’s little sister. If they really killed her like this, they’d probably have an uprising on their hands,” says Johanna flatly. “Don’t want that, do they?” She throws back her head and shouts, “Whole country in rebellion? Wouldn’t want anything like that!”<br/>My mouth drops open in shock. No one, ever, says anything like this in the Games. Absolutely, they’ve cut away from Johanna, are editing her out. But I have heard her and can never think about her again in the same way. She’ll never win any awards for kindness, but she certainly is gutsy. Or crazy. She picks up some shells and heads toward the jungle. “I’m getting water,” she says.<br/>I can’t help catching her hand as she passes me. “Don’t go in there. The birds—” I remember the birds must be gone, but I still don’t want anyone in there. Not even her.<br/>“They can’t hurt me. I’m not like the rest of you. There’s no one left I love,” Johanna says, and frees her hand with an impatient shake. When she brings me back a shell of water, I take it with a silent nod of thanks, knowing how much she would despise the pity in my voice.<br/>While Johanna collects water and my arrows, Beetee fiddles with his wire, and Finnick takes to the water. I need to clean up, too, but I stay in Peeta’s arms, still too shaken to move.</td>

<td>Who did they use against Finnick?” he asks.<br/>“Somebody named Annie,” I say.<br/>“Must be Annie Cresta,” he says.<br/>“Who?” I ask.<br/>“Annie Cresta. She was the girl Mags volunteered for. She won about five years ago,” says Peeta.<br/>That would have been the summer after my father died, when I first began feeding my family, when my whole being was occupied with battling starvation. “I don’t remember those Games much,” I say. “Was that the earthquake year?”<br/>“Yeah. Annie’s the one who went mad when her district partner got beheaded. Ran off by herself and hid. But an earthquake broke a dam and most of the arena got flooded. She won because she was the best swimmer,” says Peeta.<br/>“Did she get better after?” I ask. “I mean, her mind?”<br/>“I don’t know. I don’t remember ever seeing her at the Games again. But she didn’t look too stable during the reaping this year,” says Peeta.<br/>So that’s who Finnick loves, I think. Not his string of fancy lovers in the Capitol. But a poor, mad girl back home.<br/>A cannon blast brings us all together on the beach. A hovercraft appears in what we estimate to be the six-to-seven-o’clock zone. We watch as the claw dips down five different times to retrieve the pieces of one body, torn apart. It’s impossible to tell who it was. Whatever happens at six o’clock, I never want to know.</td>

I take a quick swim and put more ointment on my skin. Then I sit at the edge of the water, cleaning the fish Finnick catches and watching the sun drop below the horizon.

<td>Beetee essentially gives us the afternoon off while he works with the wire. Since it’s his weapon and the rest of us have to defer to his knowledge so entirely, there’s the odd feeling of being let out of school early. At first we take turns having naps in the shadowy edge of the jungle, but by late afternoon everyone is awake and restless. We decide, since this might be our last chance for seafood, to make a sort of feast of it. Under Finnick’s guidance we spear fish and gather shellfish, even dive for oysters. I like this last part best, not because I have any great appetite for oysters. I only ever tasted them once, in the Capitol, and I couldn’t get around the sliminess. But it’s lovely, deep down under the water, like being in a different world. The water’s very clear, and schools of bright-hued fish and strange sea flowers decorate the sand floor.<br/>Johanna keeps watch while Finnick, Peeta, and I clean and lay out the seafood. Peeta’s just pried open an oyster when I hear him give a laugh. “Hey, look at this!” He holds up a glistening, perfect pearl about the size of a pea. “You know, if you put enough pressure on coal it turns to pearls,” he says earnestly to Finnick.<br/>“No, it doesn’t,” says Finnick dismissively. But I crack up, remembering that’s how a clueless Effie Trinket presented us to the people of the Capitol last year, before anyone knew us. As coal pressured into pearls by our weighty existence. Beauty that arose out of pain.<br/>Peeta rinses the pearl off in the water and hands it to me. “For you.” I hold it out on my palm and examine its iridescent surface in the sunlight. Yes, I will keep it. For the few remaining hours of my life I will keep it close. This last gift from Peeta. The only one I can really accept.

He made sure the wire was among the weapons. Beetee was in charge of blowing a hole in the force field. The bread we received in the arena was code for the time of the rescue. The district where the bread originated indicated the day. Three. The number of rolls the hour. Twenty-four. The hovercraft belongs to District 13.

Why?” I say, trying to hang on to the train of thought.<br/>“For the same reason the rest of us agreed to die to keep you alive,” says Finnick.<br/>“No, Johanna tried to kill me,” I say.<br/>“Johanna knocked you out to cut the tracker from your arm and lead Brutus and Enobaria away from you,” says Haymitch.<br/>“What?” My head aches so and I want them to stop talking in circles. “I don’t know what you’re—”<br/>“We had to save you because you’re the mockingjay, Katniss,” says Plutarch. “While you live, the revolution lives.”<br/>The bird, the pin, the song, the berries, the watch, the cracker, the dress that burst into flames. I am the mockingjay. The one that survived despite the Capitol’s plans. The symbol of the rebellion.<br/>It’s what I suspected in the woods when I found Bonnie and Twill escaping. Though I never really understood the magnitude. But then, I wasn’t meant to understand. I think of Haymitch’s sneering at my plans to flee District 12, start my own uprising, even the very notion that District 13 could exist. Subterfuges and deceptions. And if he could do that, behind his mask of sarcasm and drunkenness, so convincingly and for so long, what else has he lied about? I know what else.<br/>“Peeta,” I whisper, my heart sinking.<br/>“The others kept Peeta alive because if he died, we knew there’d be no keeping you in an alliance,” says Haymitch. “And we couldn’t risk leaving you unprotected.” His words are matter-of-fact, his expression unchanged, but he can’t hide the tinge of gray that colors his face.<br/>“Where is Peeta?” I hiss at him.<br/>“He was picked up by the Capitol along with Johanna and Enobaria,” says Haymitch. And finally he has the decency to drop his gaze.<br/>Technically, I am unarmed. But no one should ever underestimate the harm that fingernails can do, especially if the target is unprepared. I lunge across the table and rake mine down Haymitch’s face, causing blood to flow and damage to one eye. Then we are both screaming terrible, terrible things at each other, and Finnick is trying to drag me out, and I know it’s all Haymitch can do not to rip me apart, but I’m the mockingjay.

Whenever the words start to become distinct, I moan until they give me more painkiller and that fixes things right up.<br/>Until one time, I open my eyes and find someone I cannot block out looking down at me. Someone who will not plead, or explain, or think he can alter my design with entreaties, because he alone really knows how I operate.<br/>“Gale,” I whisper.<br/>“Hey, Catnip.” He reaches down and pushes a strand of hair out of my eyes.

<td>The credit for the survivors’ escape has landed squarely on Gale’s shoulders, although he’s loath to accept it. As soon as the Quarter Quell was over—as soon as I had been lifted from the arena—the electricity in District 12 was cut, the televisions went black, and the Seam became so silent, people could hear one another’s heartbeats. No one did anything to protest or celebrate what had happened in the arena. Yet within fifteen minutes, the sky was filled with hoverplanes and the bombs were raining down.<br/>It was Gale who thought of the Meadow, one of the few places not filled with old wooden homes embedded with coal dust. He herded those he could in its direction, including my mother and Prim. He formed the team that pulled down the fence—now just a harmless chain-link barrier, with the electricity off—and led the people into the woods. He took them to the only place he could think of, the lake my father had shown me as a child. And it was from there they watched the distant flames eat up everything they knew in the world.<br/>By dawn the bombers were long gone, the fires dying, the final stragglers rounded up. My mother and Prim had set up a medical area for the injured and were attempting to treat them with whatever they could glean from the woods. Gale had two sets of bows and arrows, one hunting knife, one fishing net, and over eight hundred terrified people to feed. With the help of those who were able-bodied, they managed for three days. And that’s when the hovercraft unexpectedly arrived to evacuate them to District 13, where there were more than enough clean, white living compartments, plenty of clothing, and three meals a day. The compartments had the disadvantage of being underground, the clothing was identical, and the food was relatively tasteless, but for the refugees of 12, these were minor considerations. They were safe. They were being cared for. They were alive and eagerly welcomed.</td>

<td>This enthusiasm was interpreted as kindness. But a man named Dalton, a District 10 refugee who’d made it to 13 on foot a few years ago, leaked the real motive to me. “They need you. Me. They need us all. Awhile back, there was some sort of pox epidemic that killed a bunch of them and left a lot more infertile. New breeding stock. That’s how they see us.” Back in 10, he’d worked on one of the beef ranches, maintaining the genetic diversity of the herd with the implantation of long-frozen cow embryos. He’s very likely right about 13, because there don’t seem to be nearly enough kids around. But so what? We’re not being kept in pens, we’re being trained for work, the children are being educated. Those over fourteen have been given entry-level ranks in the military and are addressed respectfully as “Soldier.” Every single refugee was granted automatic citizenship by the authorities of 13.<br/>Still, I hate them. But, of course, I hate almost everybody now. Myself more than anyone.<br/>The surface beneath my feet hardens, and under the carpet of ash, I feel the paving stones of the square. Around the perimeter is a shallow border of refuse where the shops stood. A heap of blackened rubble has replaced the Justice Building. I walk to the approximate site of the bakery Peeta’s family owned. Nothing much left but the melted lump of the oven. Peeta’s parents, his two older brothers—none of them made it to 13. Fewer than a dozen of what passed for District 12’s well-to-do escaped the fire. Peeta would have nothing to come home to, anyway. Except me</td>

<td>What they want is for me to truly take on the role they designed for me. The symbol of the revolution. The Mockingjay. It isn’t enough, what I’ve done in the past, defying the Capitol in the Games, providing a rallying point. I must now become the actual leader, the face, the voice, the embodiment of the revolution. The person who the districts—most of which are now openly at war with the Capitol—can count on to blaze the path to victory. I won’t have to do it alone. They have a whole team of people to make me over, dress me, write my speeches, orchestrate my appearances—as if that doesn’t sound horribly familiar—and all I have to do is play my part. Sometimes I listen to them and sometimes I just watch the perfect line of Coin’s hair and try to decide if it’s a wig. Eventually, I leave the room because my head starts to ache or it’s time to eat or if I don’t get aboveground I might start screaming. I don’t bother to say anything. I simply get up and walk out.<br/>Yesterday afternoon, as the door was closing behind me, I heard Coin say, “I told you we should have rescued the boy first.” Meaning Peeta. I couldn’t agree more. He would’ve been an excellent mouthpiece.<br/>And who did they fish out of the arena instead? Me, who won’t cooperate. Beetee, an older inventor from 3, who I rarely see because he was pulled into weapons development the minute he could sit upright. Literally, they wheeled his hospital bed into some top secret area and now he only occasionally shows up for meals. He’s very smart and very willing to help the cause, but not really firebrand material. Then there’s Finnick Odair, the sex symbol from the fishing district, who kept Peeta alive in the arena when I couldn’t. They want to transform Finnick into a rebel leader as well, but first they’ll have to get him to stay awake for more than five minutes. Even when he is conscious, you have to say everything to him three times to get through to his brain. The doctors say it’s from the electrical shock he received in the arena, but I know it’s a lot more complicated than that. I know that Finnick can’t focus on anything in 13 because he’s trying so hard to see what’s happening in the Capitol to Annie, the mad girl from his district who’s the only person on earth he loves.<br/>Despite serious reservations, I had to forgive Finnick for his role in the conspiracy that landed me here. He, at least, has some idea of what I’m going through. And it takes too much energy to stay angry with someone who cries so much.</td>

Thousands of people are dead, but he has survived and even looks well fed. On what? He can get in and out of the house through a window we always left ajar in the pantry. He must have been eating field mice. I refuse to consider the alternative.<br/>I squat down and extend a hand. “Come here, boy.” Not likely. He’s angry at his abandonment. Besides, I’m not offering food, and my ability to provide scraps has always been my main redeeming quality to him.

The Capitol had another nuclear arsenal out west, but it couldn’t attack 13 without certain retaliation. It was forced to accept 13’s deal. The Capitol demolished the visible remains of the district and cut off all access from the outside. Perhaps the Capitol’s leaders thought that, without help, 13 would die off on its own.

Every morning, you’re supposed to stick your right arm in this contraption in the wall. It tattoos the smooth inside of your forearm with your schedule for the day in a sickly purple ink. 7:00—Breakfast. 7:30—Kitchen Duties. 8:30—Education Center, Room 17. And so on. The ink is indelible until 22:00—Bathing. That’s when whatever keeps it water resistant breaks down and the whole schedule rinses away.

I just go back to our compartment or wander around 13 or fall asleep somewhere hidden. An abandoned air duct. Behind the water pipes in the laundry. There’s a closet in the Education Center that’s great because no one ever seems to need school supplies. They’re so frugal with things here, waste is practically a criminal activity. Fortunately, the people of 12 have never been wasteful. But once I saw Fulvia Cardew crumple up a sheet of paper with just a couple of words written on it and you would’ve thought she’d murdered someone from the looks she got.

What’s to keep the rebels from reneging on the deal? A verbal promise behind closed doors, even a statement written on paper—these could easily evaporate after the war.

<td>As I slide my tray along the metal shelf before the vats of food, I see breakfast is its usual dependable self—a bowl of hot grain, a cup of milk, and a small scoop of fruit or vegetables. Today, mashed turnips. All of it comes from 13’s underground farms. I sit at the table assigned to the Everdeens and the Hawthornes and some other refugees, and shovel my food down, wishing for seconds, but there are never seconds here. They have nutrition down to a science. You leave with enough calories to take you to the next meal, no more, no less. Serving size is based on your age, height, body type, health, and amount of physical labor required by your schedule. The people from 12 are already getting slightly larger portions than the natives of 13 in an effort to bring us up to weight. I guess bony soldiers tire too quickly. It’s working, though. In just a month, we’re starting to look healthier, particularly the kids.<br/>Gale sets his tray beside me and I try not to stare at his turnips too pathetically, because I really want more, and he’s already too quick to slip me his food. Even though I turn my attention to neatly folding my napkin, a spoonful of turnips slops into my bowl.<br/><br/>“You’ve got to stop that,” I say. But since I’m already scooping up the stuff, it’s not too convincing. “Really. It’s probably illegal or something.” They have very strict rules about food. For instance, if you don’t finish something and want to save it for later, you can’t take it from the dining hall. Apparently, in the early days, there was some incident of food hoarding. For a couple of people like Gale and me, who’ve been in charge of our families’ food supply for years, it doesn’t sit well.

The three figures are only just recognizable by their most striking fashion choices: Venia’s gold facial tattoos. Flavius’s orange corkscrew curls. Octavia’s light evergreen skin, which now hangs too loosely, as if her body were a slowly deflating balloon.<br/>On seeing me, Flavius and Octavia shrink back against the tiled walls like they’re anticipating an attack, even though I have never hurt them. Unkind thoughts were my worst offense against them, and those I kept to myself, so why do they recoil?<br/>The guard’s ordering me out, but by the shuffling that follows, I know Gale has somehow detained him. For answers, I cross to Venia, who was always the strongest. I crouch down and take her icy hands, which clutch mine like vises.<br/>“What happened, Venia?” I ask. “What are you doing here?”<br/>“They took us. From the Capitol,” she says hoarsely.<br/>Plutarch enters behind me. “What on earth is going on?”<br/>“Who took you?” I press her.<br/>“People,” she says vaguely. “The night you broke out.”<br/><br/>“We thought it might be comforting for you to have your regular team,” Plutarch says behind me. “Cinna requested it.”<br/>“Cinna requested this?” I snarl at him. Because if there’s one thing I know, it’s that Cinna would never have approved the abuse of these three, who he managed with gentleness and patience. “Why are they being treated like criminals?”<br/>“I honestly don’t know.” There’s something in his voice that makes me believe him, and the pallor on Fulvia’s face confirms it. Plutarch turns to the guard, who’s just appeared in the doorway with Gale right behind him. “I was only told they were being confined. Why are they being punished?”<br/>“For stealing food. We had to restrain them after an altercation over some bread,” says the guard.<br/>Venia’s brows come together as if she’s still trying to make sense of it. “No one would tell us anything. We were so hungry. It was just one slice she took.”<br/>Octavia begins to sob, muffling the sound in her ragged tunic. I think of how, the first time I survived the arena, Octavia sneaked me a roll under the table because she couldn’t bear my hunger. I crawl across to her shaking form. “Octavia?” I touch her and she flinches. “Octavia? It’s going to be all right. I’ll get you out of here, okay?”<br/>“This seems extreme,” says Plutarch.<br/>“It’s because they took a slice of bread?” asks Gale.<br/>“There were repeated infractions leading up to that. They were warned. Still they took more bread.” The guard pauses a moment, as if puzzled by our density. “You can’t take bread.”<br/><br/>I can’t get Octavia to uncover her face, but she lifts it slightly. The shackles on her wrists shift down a few inches, revealing raw sores beneath them. “I’m bringing you to my mother.” I address the guard. “Unchain them.”<br/>The guard shakes his head. “It’s not authorized.”<br/>“Unchain them! Now!” I yell.<br/>This breaks his composure. Average citizens don’t address him this way. “I have no release orders. And you have no authority to—”<br/>“Do it on my authority,” says Plutarch. “We came to collect these three anyway. They’re needed for Special Defense. I’ll take full responsibility.”<br/>The guard leaves to make a call. He returns with a set of keys.

She probably thought you’d see it as a favor.” He stuffs the rabbit in the sack and rises. “We better get going if we want to make it back on time.”<br/>I ignore his offer of a hand up and get to my feet unsteadily. “Fine.” Neither of us talks on the way back, but once we’re inside the gate, I think of something else. “During the Quarter Quell, Octavia and Flavius had to quit because they couldn’t stop crying over me going back in. And Venia could barely say good-bye.”<br/>“I’ll try and keep that in mind as they…remake you,” says Gale.<br/>“Do,” I say.<br/>We hand the meat over to Greasy Sae in the kitchen.

Next, the rebels ensnaring me in the metal claw that lifted me from the arena, designating me to be their Mockingjay, and then having to recover from the shock that I might not want the wings. And now Coin, with her fistful of precious nukes and her well-oiled machine of a district, finding it’s even harder to groom a Mockingjay than to catch one. But she has been the quickest to determine that I have an agenda of my own and am therefore not to be trusted. She has been the first to publicly brand me as a threat.</td>

<td> burn, and scar me in a more attractive way.<br/><br/>“Remake her to Beauty Base Zero,” Fulvia ordered first thing this morning. “We’ll work from there.” Beauty Base Zero turns out to be what a person would look like if they stepped out of bed looking flawless but natural. It means my nails are perfectly shaped but not polished. My hair soft and shiny but not styled. My skin smooth and clear but not painted. Wax the body hair and erase the dark circles, but don’t make any noticeable enhancements. I suppose Cinna gave the same instructions the first day I arrived as a tribute in the Capitol. Only that was different, since I was a contestant. As a rebel, I thought I’d get to look more like myself. But it seems a televised rebel has her own standards to live up to.<br/>After I rinse the lather from my body, I turn to find Octavia waiting with a towel. She is so altered from the woman I knew in the Capitol, stripped of the gaudy clothing, the heavy makeup, the dyes and jewelry and knickknacks she adorned her hair with. I remember how one day she showed up with bright pink tresses studded with blinking colored lights shaped like mice. She told me she had several mice at home as pets. The thought repulsed me at the time, since we consider mice vermin, unless cooked. But perhaps Octavia liked them because they were small, soft, and squeaky. Like her. As she pats me dry, I try to become acquainted with the District 13 Octavia. Her real hair turns out to be a nice auburn. Her face is ordinary but has an undeniable sweetness. She’s younger than I thought. Maybe early twenties. Devoid of the three-inch decorative nails, her fingers appear almost stubby, and they can’t stop trembling. I want to tell her it’s okay, that I’ll see that Coin never hurts her again. But the multicolored bruises flowering under her green skin only remind me how impotent I am.<br/>Flavius, too, appears washed out without his purple lipstick and bright clothes. He’s managed to get his orange ringlets back in some sort of order, though. It’s Venia who’s the least changed. Her aqua hair lies flat instead of in spikes and you can see the roots growing in gray. However, the tattoos were always her most striking characteristic, and they’re as golden and shocking as ever. She comes and takes the towel from Octavia’s hands.<br/>“Katniss is not going to hurt us,” she says quietly but firmly to Octavia. “Katniss did not even know we were here. Things will be better now.” Octavia gives a slight nod but doesn’t dare look me in the eye.</td>

Are you sick?”<br/>“It’s a fashion thing, Posy. Like wearing lipstick,” I say.<br/>“It’s meant to be pretty,” whispers Octavia, and I can see the tears threatening to spill over her lashes.<br/>Posy considers this and says matter-of-factly, “I think you’d be pretty in any color.”<br/>The tiniest of smiles forms on Octavia’s lips. “Thank you.”<br/>“If you really want to impress Posy, you’ll have to dye yourself bright pink,” says Gale, thumping his tray down beside me. “That’s her favorite color.” Posy giggles and slides back down to her mother. Gale nods at Flavius’s bowl. “I wouldn’t let that get cold. It doesn’t improve the consistency.”<br/>Everyone gets down to eating. The stew doesn’t taste bad, but there’s a certain sliminess that’s hard to get around. Like you have to swallow every bite three times before it really goes down.<br/>Gale, who’s not usually much of a talker during meals, makes an effort to keep the conversation going, asking about the makeover. I know it’s his attempt at smoothing things over. We argued last night after he suggested I’d left Coin no choice but to counter my demand for the victors’ safety with one of her own. “Katniss, she’s running this district. She can’t do it if it seems like she’s caving in to your will.”<br/>“You mean she can’t stand any dissent, even if it’s fair,” I’d countered.<br/>“I mean you put her in a bad position.

His face takes on that distant look it wears when he’s working something out. “Take a net with a very fine mesh. Enclose an area and leave a mouth of a couple square feet. Bait the inside with nectar flowers. While they’re feeding, snap the mouth shut. They’d fly away from the noise but only encounter the far side of the net.”<br/>“Would that work?” asks Beetee.<br/>“I don’t know. Just an idea,” says Gale. “They might outsmart it.”<br/>“They might.

<td>The first thing Haymitch does is to show the footage we’ve just shot. I seem to have reached some new low under Plutarch and Fulvia’s guidance. Both my voice and body have a jerky, disjointed quality, like a puppet being manipulated by unseen forces.<br/>“All right,” Haymitch says when it’s over. “Would anyone like to argue that this is of use to us in winning the war?” No one does. “That saves time. So, let’s all be quiet for a minute. I want everyone to think of one incident where Katniss Everdeen genuinely moved you. Not where you were jealous of her hairstyle, or her dress went up in flames or she made a halfway decent shot with an arrow. Not where Peeta was making you like her. I want to hear one moment where she made you feel something real.”<br/>Quiet stretches out and I’m beginning to think it will never end, when Leevy speaks up. “When she volunteered to take Prim’s place at the reaping. Because I’m sure she thought she was going to die.”<br/>“Good. Excellent example,” says Haymitch. He takes a purple marker and writes on a notepad. “Volunteered for sister at reaping.” Haymitch looks around the table. “Somebody else.”<br/><br/>I’m surprised that the next speaker is Boggs, who I think of as a muscular robot that does Coin’s bidding. “When she sang the song. While the little girl died.” Somewhere in my head an image surfaces of Boggs with a young boy perched up on his hip. In the dining hall, I think. Maybe he’s not a robot after all.<br/>“Who didn’t get choked up at that, right?” says Haymitch, writing it down.<br/>“I cried when she drugged Peeta so she could go get him medicine and when she kissed him good-bye!” blurts out Octavia. Then she covers her mouth, like she’s sure this was a bad mistake.<br/>But Haymitch only nods. “Oh, yeah. Drugs Peeta to save his life. Very nice.”<br/>The moments begin to come thick and fast and in no particular order. When I took Rue on as an ally. Extended my hand to Chaff on interview night. Tried to carry Mags. And again and again when I held out those berries that meant different things to different people. Love for Peeta. Refusal to give in under impossible odds. Defiance of the Capitol’s inhumanity.<br/>Haymitch holds up the notepad. “So, the question is, what do all of these have in common?”<br/>“They were Katniss’s,” says Gale quietly. “No one told her what to do or say.”<br/>“Unscripted, yes!” says Beetee. He reaches over and pats my hand. “So we should just leave you alone, right?”<br/>People laugh. I even smile a little.<br/>“Well, that’s all very nice but not very helpful,” says Fulvia peevishly. “Unfortunately, her opportunities for being wonderful are rather limited here in Thirteen. So unless you’re suggesting we toss her into the middle of combat—”<br/>“That’s exactly what I’m suggesting,” says Haymitch. “Put her out in the field and just keep the cameras rolling.”<br/>“But people think she’s pregnant,” Gale points out.<br/>“We’ll spread the word that she lost the baby from the electrical shock in the arena,” Plutarch replies. “Very sad. Very unfortunate.”<br/>The idea of sending me into combat is controversial. But Haymitch has a pretty tight case. If I perform well only in real-life circumstances, then into them I should go. “Every time we coach her or give her lines, the best we can hope for is okay. It has to come from her. That’s what people are responding to.”<br/>“Even if we’re careful, we can’t guarantee her safety,” says Boggs. “She’ll be a target for every—”<br/>“I want to go,” I break in. “I’m no help to the rebels here.”<br/>“And if you’re killed?” asks Coin.<br/>“Make sure you get some footage. You can use that, anyway,” I answer.<br/>“Fine,” says Coin. “But let’s take it one step at a time. Find the least dangerous situation that can evoke some spontaneity in you.” She walks around Command, studying the illuminated district maps that show the ongoing troop positions in the war. “Take her into Eight this afternoon. There was heavy bombing this morning, but the raid seems to have run its course. I want her armed with a squad of bodyguards. Camera crew on the ground. Haymitch, you’ll be airborne and in contact with her. Let’s see what happens there. Does anyone have any other comments?”<br/>“Wash her face,” says Dalton. Everyone turns to him. “She’s still a girl and you made her look thirty-five. Feels wrong. Like something the Capitol would do.”</td>

The others leave except for Gale, who lingers uncertainly by my side. “What are you worried about?” Haymitch asks him. “I’m the one who needs the bodyguard.”<br/>“It’s okay,” I tell Gale, and he goes. Then there’s just the hum of the instruments, the purr of the ventilation system.<br/>Haymitch takes the seat across from me. “We’re going to have to work together again. So, go ahead. Just say it.”<br/>I think of the snarling, cruel exchange back on the hovercraft. The bitterness that followed. But all I say is “I can’t believe you didn’t rescue Peeta.”<br/>“I know,” he replies.<br/>There’s a sense of incompleteness. And not because he hasn’t apologized. But because we were a team. We had a deal to keep Peeta safe. A drunken, unrealistic deal made in the dark of night, but a deal just the same. And in my heart of hearts, I know we both failed.<br/>“Now you say it,” I tell him.<br/>“I can’t believe you let him out of your sight that night,” says Haymitch.<br/>I nod. That’s it. “I play it over and over in my head. What I could have done to keep him by my side without breaking the alliance. But nothing comes to me.”<br/><br/>“You didn’t have a choice. And even if I could’ve made Plutarch stay and rescue him that night, the whole hovercraft would’ve gone down. We barely got out as it was.” I finally meet Haymitch’s eyes. Seam eyes. Gray and deep and ringed with the circles of sleepless nights. “He’s not dead yet, Katniss.”<br/>“We’re still in the game.” I try to say this with optimism, but my voice cracks.<br/>“Still in. And I’m still your mentor.” Haymitch points his marker at me. “When you’re on the ground, remember I’m airborne.

<td>Boggs shows up to escort me down to the Airborne Division. Just as the elevator arrives, Finnick appears in a state of agitation. “Katniss, they won’t let me go! I told them I’m fine, but they won’t even let me ride in the hovercraft!”<br/>I take in Finnick—his bare legs showing between his hospital gown and slippers, his tangle of hair, the half-knotted rope twisted around his fingers, the wild look in his eyes—and know any plea on my part will be useless. Even I don’t think it’s a good idea to bring him. So I smack my hand on my forehead and say, “Oh, I forgot. It’s this stupid concussion. I was supposed to tell you to report to Beetee in Special Weaponry. He’s designed a new trident for you.”<br/>At the word trident, it’s as if the old Finnick surfaces. “Really? What’s it do?”<br/>“I don’t know. But if it’s anything like my bow and arrows, you’re going to love it,” I say. “You’ll need to train with it, though.”<br/>“Right. Of course. I guess I better get down there,” he says.<br/>“Finnick?” I say. “Maybe some pants?”<br/>He looks down at his legs as if noticing his outfit for the first time. Then he whips off his hospital gown, leaving him in just his underwear. “Why? Do you find this”—he strikes a ridiculously provocative pose—“distracting?”<br/>I can’t help laughing because it’s funny, and it’s extra funny because it makes Boggs look so uncomfortable, and I’m happy because Finnick actually sounds like the guy I met at the Quarter Quell.<br/><br/>“I’m only human, Odair.” I get in before the elevator doors close. “Sorry,” I say to Boggs.<br/>“Don’t be.

They’ve been updated, of course,” says Boggs.<br/>I feel that twinge of hatred against 13 again. “So, you had all this, and you left the rest of the districts defenseless against the Capitol.”<br/>“It’s not that simple,” he shoots back. “We were in no position to launch a counterattack until recently. We could barely stay alive. After we’d overthrown and executed the Capitol’s people, only a handful of us even knew how to pilot. We could’ve nuked them with missiles, yes. But there’s always the larger question: If we engage in that type of war with the Capitol, would there be any human life left?”<br/>“That sounds like what Peeta said. And you all called him a traitor,” I counter.<br/>“Because he called for a cease-fire,” says Boggs. “You’ll notice neither side has launched nuclear weapons.

During migration season, when we hunt fowl, we’ve developed a system of dividing the birds so we don’t both target the same ones. I get the far side of the V, Gale takes the near, and we alternate shots at the front bird. There’s no time for further discussion. I estimate the lead time on the hoverplanes and let my arrow fly. I catch the inside wing of one, causing it to burst into flames. Gale just misses the point plane. A fire blooms on an empty warehouse roof across from us.

When my feet hit the ground, I find a bodyguard, Cressida, and the other insect waiting. I expect resistance, but Cressida just waves me toward the hospital. She’s yelling, “I don’t care, Plutarch! Just give me five more minutes!” Not one to question a free pass, I take off into the street.<br/>“Oh, no,” I whisper as I catch sight of the hospital. What used to be the hospital. I move past the wounded, past the burning plane wrecks, fixated on the disaster ahead of me. People screaming, running about frantically, but unable to help. The bombs have collapsed the hospital roof and set the building on fire, effectively trapping the patients within. A group of rescuers has assembled, trying to clear a path to the inside. But I already know what they will find. If the crushing debris and the flames didn’t get them, the smoke did.<br/>Gale’s at my shoulder. The fact that he does nothing only confirms my suspicions. Miners don’t abandon an accident until it’s hopeless.<br/>“Come on, Katniss. Haymitch says they can get a hovercraft in for us now,” he tells me. But I can’t seem to move.<br/>“Why would they do that? Why would they target people who were already dying?” I ask him.<br/>“Scare others off. Prevent the wounded from seeking help,” says Gale. “Those people you met, they were expendable. To Snow, anyway. If the Capitol wins, what will it do with a bunch of damaged slaves?”<br/>I remember all those years in the woods, listening to Gale rant against the Capitol. Me, not paying close attention. Wondering why he even bothered to dissect its motives. Why thinking like our enemy would ever matter. Clearly, it could have mattered today. When Gale questioned the existence of the hospital, he was not thinking of disease, but this. Because he never underestimates the cruelty of those we face.</td>

Would you like to tell the rebels anything?”<br/>“Yes,” I whisper. The red blinking light on one of the cameras catches my eye. I know I’m being recorded. “Yes,” I say more forcefully. Everyone is drawing away from me—Gale, Cressida, the insects—giving me the stage. But I stay focused on the red light. “I want to tell the rebels that I am alive. That I’m right here in District Eight, where the Capitol has just bombed a hospital full of unarmed men, women, and children. There will be no survivors.” The shock I’ve been feeling begins to give way to fury. “I want to tell people that if you think for one second the Capitol will treat us fairly if there’s a cease-fire, you’re deluding yourself. Because you know who they are and what they do.” My hands go out automatically, as if to indicate the whole horror around me. “This is what they do! And we must fight back!”<br/>I’m moving in toward the camera now, carried forward by my rage. “President Snow says he’s sending us a message? Well, I have one for him. You can torture us and bomb us and burn our districts to the ground, but do you see that?” One of the cameras follows as I point to the planes burning on the roof of the warehouse across from us.

The adrenaline rush that overrode the sensation has passed and my body parts join in a chorus of complaints. I’m banged up and bloody and someone seems to be hammering on my left temple from inside my skull. Boggs quickly examines my face, then scoops me up and jogs for the runway. Halfway there, I puke on his bulletproof vest. It’s hard to tell because he’s short of breath, but I think he sighs</td>

I start to get up and then realize they plan to roll my hospital bed directly there. I want to walk, but that’s out, so I negotiate my way into a wheelchair. I feel fine, really. Except for my head, and my leg, and the soreness from the bruises, and the nausea that hit a couple minutes after I ate. Maybe the wheelchair’s a good idea.</td>

Messalla beams and says, “There’s our little star!” and the others are smiling so genuinely that I can’t help but smile in return. They impressed me in 8, following me onto the roof during the bombing, making Plutarch back off so they could get the footage they wanted. They more than do their work, they take pride in it. Like Cinna.<br/>I have a strange thought that if we were in the arena together, I would pick them as allies. Cressida, Messalla, and—and—“I have to stop calling you ‘the insects,’” I blurt out to the cameramen. I explain how I didn’t know their names, but their suits suggested the shelled creatures. The comparison doesn’t seem to bother them. Even without the camera shells, they strongly resemble each other. Same sandy hair, red beards, and blue eyes. The one with close-bitten nails introduces himself as Castor and the other, who’s his brother, as Pollux. I wait for Pollux to say hello, but he just nods. At first I think he’s shy or a man of few words. But something tugs on me—the position of his lips, the extra effort he takes to swallow—and I know before Castor tells me. Pollux is an Avox. They have cut out his tongue and he will never speak again. And I no longer have to wonder what made him risk everything to help bring down the Capitol.</td>

Then she doesn’t know that I flagrantly disregarded orders, ripped out my earpiece, and gave my bodyguards the slip? What else have they kept from her?<br/>“It was a tough call,” says Plutarch, furrowing his brow. “But the general consensus was that we weren’t going to get anything worth using if we locked her in a bunker somewhere every time a gun went off.”<br/>“And you’re all right with that?” asks the president.<br/>Gale has to kick me under the table before I realize that she’s talking to me. “Oh!

<td>So, what else do you have planned?” asks the president.<br/>Plutarch nods to Cressida, who consults a clipboard. “We have some terrific footage of Katniss at the hospital in Eight. There should be another propo in that with the theme ‘Because you know who they are and what they do.’ We’ll focus on Katniss interacting with the patients, particularly the children, the bombing of the hospital, and the wreckage. Messalla’s cutting that together. We’re also thinking about a Mockingjay piece. Highlight some of Katniss’s best moments intercut with scenes of rebel uprisings and war footage. We call that one ‘Fire is catching.’ And then Fulvia came up with a really brilliant idea.”<br/>Fulvia’s mouthful-of-sour-grapes expression is startled right off her face, but she recovers. “Well, I don’t know how brilliant it is, but I was thinking we could do a series of propos called We Remember. In each one, we would feature one of the dead tributes. Little Rue from Eleven or old Mags from Four. The idea being that we could target each district with a very personal piece.”<br/>“A tribute to your tributes, as it were,” says Plutarch.<br/>“That is brilliant, Fulvia,” I say sincerely. “It’s the perfect way to remind people why they’re fighting.”<br/>“I think it could work,” she says. “I thought we might use Finnick to intro and narrate the spots. If there was interest in them.”<br/>“Frankly, I don’t see how we could have too many We Remember propos,” says Coin. “Can you start producing them today?”<br/>“Of course,” says Fulvia, obviously mollified by the response to her idea.<br/>Cressida has smoothed everything over in the creative department with her gesture. Praised Fulvia for what is, in fact, a really good idea, and cleared the way to continue her own on-air depiction of the Mockingjay. What’s interesting is that Plutarch seems to have no need to share in the credit. All he wants is for the Airtime Assault to work. I remember that Plutarch is a Head Gamemaker, not a member of the crew. Not a piece in the Games. Therefore, his worth is not defined by a single element, but by the overall success of the production. If we win the war, that’s when Plutarch will take his bow. And expect his reward.</td>

<td>At dinner, Finnick brings his tray to my bed so we can watch the newest propo together on television. He was assigned quarters on my old floor, but he has so many mental relapses, he still basically lives in the hospital. The rebels air the “Because you know who they are and what they do” propo that Messalla edited. The footage is intercut with short studio clips of Gale, Boggs, and Cressida describing the incident. It’s hard to watch my reception in the hospital in 8 since I know what’s coming. When the bombs rain down on the roof, I bury my face in my pillow, looking up again at a brief clip of me at the end, after all the victims are dead.<br/>At least Finnick doesn’t applaud or act all happy when it’s done. He just says, “People should know that happened. And now they do.”<br/>“Let’s turn it off, Finnick, before they run it again,” I urge him. But as Finnick’s hand moves toward the remote control, I cry, “Wait!” The Capitol is introducing a special segment and something about it looks familiar. Yes, it’s Caesar Flickerman. And I can guess who his guest will be.<br/>Peeta’s physical transformation shocks me. The healthy, clear-eyed boy I saw a few days ago has lost at least fifteen pounds and developed a nervous tremor in his hands. They’ve still got him groomed. But underneath the paint that cannot cover the bags under his eyes, and the fine clothes that cannot conceal the pain he feels when he moves, is a person badly damaged.<br/><br/>My mind reels, trying to make sense of it. I just saw him! Four—no, five—I think it was five days ago. How has he deteriorated so rapidly? What could they possibly have done to him in such a short time? Then it hits me. I replay in my mind as much as I can of his first interview with Caesar, searching for anything that would place it in time. There is nothing. They could have taped that interview a day or two after I blew up the arena, then done whatever they wanted to do to him ever since. “Oh, Peeta…” I whisper.<br/>Caesar and Peeta have a few empty exchanges before Caesar asks him about rumors that I’m taping propos for the districts. “They’re using her, obviously,” says Peeta. “To whip up the rebels. I doubt she even really knows what’s going on in the war. What’s at stake.”<br/>“Is there anything you’d like to tell her?” asks Caesar.<br/>“There is,” says Peeta. He looks directly into the camera, right into my eyes. “Don’t be a fool, Katniss. Think for yourself. They’ve turned you into a weapon that could be instrumental in the destruction of humanity. If you’ve got any real influence, use it to put the brakes on this thing. Use it to stop the war before it’s too late. Ask yourself, do you really trust the people you’re working with? Do you really know what’s going on? And if you don’t…find out.”<br/>Black screen. Seal of Panem. Show over.<br/>Finnick presses the button on the remote that kills the power. In a minute, people will be here to do damage control on Peeta’s condition and the words that came out of his mouth. I will need to repudiate them. But the truth is, I don’t trust the rebels or Plutarch or Coin. I’m not confident that they tell me the truth. I won’t be able to conceal this. Footsteps are approaching.<br/>Finnick grips me hard by the arms. “We didn’t see it.”<br/>“What?” I ask.<br/>“We didn’t see Peeta. Only the propo on Eight. Then we turned the set off because the images upset you. Got it?” he asks. I nod. “Finish your dinner.” I pull myself together enough so that when Plutarch and Fulvia enter, I have a mouthful of bread and cabbage. Finnick is talking about how well Gale came across on camera. We congratulate them on the propo. Make it clear it was so powerful, we tuned out right afterward. They look relieved. They believe us.<br/>No one mentions Peeta.</td>

They thought if I’m going to be in the field with you, it could be a backup system of communication,” says Gale.<br/>No one has ever offered me a communicuff. I wonder, if I asked for one, would I get it? “Well, I guess one of us has to be accessible,” I say with an edge to my voice.<br/>“What’s that mean?” he says.<br/>“Nothing. Just repeating what you said,” I tell him. “And I totally agree that the accessible one should be you. I just hope I still have access to you as well.”<br/>Our eyes lock, and I realize how furious I am with Gale. That I don’t believe for a second that he didn’t see Peeta’s propo. That I feel completely betrayed that he didn’t tell me about it. We know each other too well for him not to read my mood and guess what has caused it.<br/>“Katniss—” he begins. Already the admission of guilt is in his tone.<br/>I grab my tray, cross to the deposit area, and slam the dishes onto the rack. By the time I’m in the hallway, he’s caught up with me.<br/>“Why didn’t you say something?” he asks, taking my arm.<br/>“Why didn’t I?” I jerk my arm free. “Why didn’t you, Gale? And I did, by the way, when I asked you last night about what had been going on!”<br/>“I’m sorry. All right? I didn’t know what to do. I wanted to tell you, but everyone was afraid that seeing Peeta’s propo would make you sick,” he says.<br/><br/>“They were right. It did. But not quite as sick as you lying to me for Coin.” At that moment, his communicuff starts beeping. “There she is. Better run. You have things to tell her.”<br/>For a moment, real hurt registers on his face. Then cold anger replaces it. He turns on his heel and goes. Maybe I have been too spiteful, not given him enough time to explain. Maybe everyone is just trying to protect me by lying to me. I don’t care. I’m sick of people lying to me for my own good. Because really it’s mostly for their own good. Lie to Katniss about the rebellion so she doesn’t do anything crazy. Send her into the arena without a clue so we can fish her out. Don’t tell her about Peeta’s propo because it might make her sick, and it’s hard enough to get a decent performance out of her as it is.</td>

Then, to my surprise, Pollux whistles a few notes of his own. The bird answers him immediately. Pollux’s face breaks into an expression of delight and he has a series of melodic exchanges with the mockingjay. My guess is it’s the first conversation he’s had in years.

In one more verse, surely they will have captured the melody, as it’s simple and repeats four times with little variation.<br/><br/><br/>“Are you, are you<br/>Coming to the tree<br/>Where I told you to run, so we’d both be free.<br/>Strange things did happen here<br/>No stranger would it be<br/>If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree.”<br/><br/>A hush in the trees. Just the rustle of leaves in the breeze. But no birds, mockingjay or other. Peeta’s right. They do fall silent when I sing. Just as they did for my father.<br/><br/>“Are you, are you<br/>Coming to the tree<br/>Wear a necklace of rope, side by side with me.<br/>Strange things did happen here<br/>No stranger would it be<br/>If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree.”<br/><br/>The birds are waiting for me to continue. But that’s it. Last verse. In the stillness I remember the scene. I was home from a day in the woods with my father. Sitting on the floor with Prim, who was just a toddler, singing “The Hanging Tree.” Making us necklaces out of scraps of old rope like it said in the song, not knowing the real meaning of the words. The tune was simple and easy to harmonize to, though, and back then I could memorize almost anything set to music after a round or two. Suddenly, my mother snatched the rope necklaces away and was yelling at my father. I started to cry because my mother never yelled, and then Prim was wailing and I ran outside to hide. As I had exactly one hiding spot—in the Meadow under a honeysuckle bush—my father found me immediately. He calmed me down and told me everything was fine, only we’d better not sing that song anymore. My mother just wanted me to forget it. So, of course, every word was immediately, irrevocably branded into my brain.<br/>We didn’t sing it anymore, my father and I, or even speak of it. After he died, it used to come back to me a lot. Being older, I began to understand the lyrics. At the beginning, it sounds like a guy is trying to get his girlfriend to secretly meet up with him at midnight. But it’s an odd place for a tryst, a hanging tree, where a man was hung for murder. The murderer’s lover must have had something to do with the killing, or maybe they were just going to punish her anyway, because his corpse called out for her to flee. That’s weird obviously, the talking-corpse bit, but it’s not until the third verse that “The Hanging Tree” begins to get unnerving. You realize the singer of the song is the dead murderer. He’s still in the hanging tree. And even though he told his lover to flee, he keeps asking if she’s coming to meet him. The phrase Where I told you to run, so we’d both be free is the most troubling because at first you think he’s talking about when he told her to flee, presumably to safety. But then you wonder if he meant for her to run to him. To death. In the final stanza, it’s clear that that’s what he’s waiting for. His lover, with her rope necklace, hanging dead next to him in the tree.<br/><br/>I used to think the murderer was the creepiest guy imaginable. Now, with a couple of trips to the Hunger Games under my belt, I decide not to judge him without knowing more details. Maybe his lover was already sentenced to death and he was trying to make it easier. To let her know he’d be waiting. Or maybe he thought the place he was leaving her was really worse than death. Didn’t I want to kill Peeta with that syringe to save him from the Capitol? Was that really my only option? Probably not, but I couldn’t think of another at the time.<br/>I guess my mother thought the whole thing was too twisted for a seven-year-old, though. Especially one who made her own rope necklaces. It wasn’t like hanging was something that only happened in a story. Plenty of people were executed that way in 12. You can bet she didn’t want me singing it in front of my music class. She probably wouldn’t like me doing it here for Pollux even, but at least I’m not—wait, no, I’m wrong. As I glance sideways, I see Castor has been taping me. Everyone is watching me intently. And Pollux has tears running down his cheeks because no doubt my freaky song has dredged up some terrible incident in his life. Great. I sigh and lean back against the trunk. That’s when the mockingjays begin their rendition of “The Hanging Tree.” In their mouths, it’s quite beautiful. Conscious of being filmed, I stand quietly until I hear Cressida call, “Cut!”<br/></td>

He asks Peeta if, given tonight’s demonstration, he has any parting thoughts for Katniss Everdeen.<br/>At the mention of my name, Peeta’s face contorts in effort. “Katniss…how do you think this will end? What will be left? No one is safe. Not in the Capitol. Not in the districts. And you…in Thirteen…” He inhales sharply, as if fighting for air; his eyes look insane. “Dead by morning!”<br/>Off camera, Snow orders, “End it!” Beetee throws the whole thing into chaos by flashing a still shot of me standing in front of the hospital at three-second intervals. But between the images, we are privy to the real-life action being played out on the set. Peeta’s attempt to continue speaking. The camera knocked down to record the white tiled floor. The scuffle of boots. The impact of the blow that’s inseparable from Peeta’s cry of pain.<br/>And his blood as it splatters the tiles.</td>

<td>The faint sound of the sirens cuts off sharply. Coin’s voice comes over the district audio system, thanking us all for an exemplary evacuation of the upper levels. She stresses that this is not a drill, as Peeta Mellark, the District 12 victor, has possibly made a televised reference to an attack on 13 tonight.<br/>That’s when the first bomb hits. There’s an initial sense of impact followed by an explosion that resonates in my innermost parts, the lining of my intestines, the marrow of my bones, the roots of my teeth. We’re all going to die, I think. My eyes turn upward, expecting to see giant cracks race across the ceiling, massive chunks of stone raining down on us, but the bunker itself gives only a slight shudder. The lights go out and I experience the disorientation of total darkness. Speechless human sounds—spontaneous shrieks, ragged breaths, baby whimpers, one musical bit of insane laughter—dance around in the charged air. Then there’s a hum of a generator, and a dim wavering glow replaces the stark lighting that is the norm in 13. It’s closer to what we had in our homes in 12, when the candles and fire burned low on a winter’s night</td>

<td>We’re so far down, I’m sure we’re safe,” says my mother wanly. Is she thinking of my father’s being blown to nothingness in the mines? “It was a close call, though. Thank goodness Peeta had the wherewithal to warn us.”<br/>The wherewithal. A general term that somehow includes everything that was needed for him to sound the alarm. The knowledge, the opportunity, the courage. And something else I can’t define. Peeta seemed to have been waging a sort of battle in his mind, fighting to get the message out. Why? The ease with which he manipulates words is his greatest talent. Was his difficulty a result of his torture? Something more? Like madness?<br/>Coin’s voice, perhaps a shade grimmer, fills the bunker, the volume level flickering with the lights. “Apparently, Peeta Mellark’s information was sound and we owe him a great debt of gratitude. Sensors indicate the first missile was not nuclear, but very powerful. We expect more will follow. For the duration of the attack, citizens are to stay in their assigned areas unless otherwise notified.”<br/>A soldier alerts my mother that she’s needed in the first-aid station. She’s reluctant to leave us, even though she’ll only be thirty yards away.<br/>“We’ll be fine, really,” I tell her. “Do you think anything could get past him?” I point to Buttercup, who gives me such a halfhearted hiss, we all have to laugh a little. Even I feel sorry for him. After my mother goes, I suggest, “Why don’t you climb in with him, Prim?”<br/>“I know it’s silly…but I’m afraid the bunk might collapse on us during the attack,” she says.</td>

<td>I curl up with Prim on the mattress, double layering the blankets because the cavern emits a dank chill. Buttercup, miserable even with Prim’s constant attention, huddles in the cube and exhales cat breath in my face.<br/>Despite the disagreeable conditions, I’m glad to have time with my sister. My extreme preoccupation since I came here—no, since the first Games, really—has left little attention for her. I haven’t been watching over her the way I should, the way I used to. After all, it was Gale who checked our compartment, not me. Something to make up for.<br/>I realize I’ve never even bothered to ask her about how she’s handling the shock of coming here. “So, how are you liking Thirteen, Prim?” I offer.<br/>“Right now?” she asks. We both laugh. “I miss home badly sometimes. But then I remember there’s nothing left to miss anymore. I feel safer here. We don’t have to worry about you. Well, not the same way.” She pauses, and then a shy smile crosses her lips. “I think they’re going to train me to be a doctor.”<br/>It’s the first I’ve heard of it. “Well, of course, they are. They’d be stupid not to.”<br/>“They’ve been watching me when I help out in the hospital. I’m already taking the medic courses. It’s just beginner’s stuff. I know a lot of it from home. Still, there’s plenty to learn,” she tells me.<br/><br/>“That’s great,” I say. Prim a doctor. She couldn’t even dream of it in 12. Something small and quiet, like a match being struck, lights up the gloom inside me. This is the sort of future a rebellion could bring.<br/>“What about you, Katniss? How are you managing?” Her fingertip moves in short, gentle strokes between Buttercup’s eyes. “And don’t say you’re fine.”<br/>It’s true. Whatever the opposite of fine is, that’s what I am. So I go ahead and tell her about Peeta, his deterioration on-screen, and how I think they must be killing him at this very moment. Buttercup has to rely on himself for a while, because now Prim turns her attention to me. Pulling me closer, brushing the hair back behind my ears with her fingers. I’ve stopped talking because there’s really nothing left to say and there’s this piercing sort of pain where my heart is. Maybe I’m even having a heart attack, but it doesn’t seem worth mentioning.<br/>“Katniss, I don’t think President Snow will kill Peeta,” she says. Of course, she says this; it’s what she thinks will calm me. But her next words come as a surprise. “If he does, he won’t have anyone left you want. He won’t have any way to hurt you.”<br/>Suddenly, I am reminded of another girl, one who had seen all the evil the Capitol had to offer. Johanna Mason, the tribute from District 7, in the last arena. I was trying to prevent her from going into the jungle where the jabberjays mimicked the voices of loved ones being tortured, but she brushed me off, saying, “They can’t hurt me. I’m not like the rest of you. There’s no one left I love.”<br/><br/>Then I know Prim is right, that Snow cannot afford to waste Peeta’s life, especially now, while the Mockingjay causes so much havoc. He’s killed Cinna already. Destroyed my home. My family, Gale, and even Haymitch are out of his reach. Peeta’s all he has left.<br/>“So, what do you think they’ll do to him?” I ask.<br/>Prim sounds about a thousand years old when she speaks.<br/>“Whatever it takes to break you.”</td>

What will break me into a million pieces so that I am beyond repair, beyond usefulness? I mention it to no one, but it devours my waking hours and weaves itself throughout my nightmares.<br/>Four more bunker missiles fall over this period, all massive, all very damaging, but there’s no urgency to the attack. The bombs are spread out over the long hours so that just when you think the raid is over, another blast sends shock waves through your guts. It feels more designed to keep us in lockdown than to decimate 13. Cripple the district, yes. Give the people plenty to do to get the place running again. But destroy it? No. Coin was right on that point. You don’t destroy what you want to acquire in the future.

Small periods of socialization are granted to alleviate the tedium. Our space becomes very popular because both children and adults have a fascination with Buttercup. He attains celebrity status with his evening game of Crazy Cat. I created this by accident a few years ago, during a winter blackout. You simply wiggle a flashlight beam around on the floor, and Buttercup tries to catch it. I’m petty enough to enjoy it because I think it makes him look stupid. Inexplicably, everyone here thinks he’s clever and delightful. I’m even issued a special set of batteries—an enormous waste—to be used for this purpose.

<td>It’s on the third night, during our game, that I answer the question eating away at me. Crazy Cat becomes a metaphor for my situation. I am Buttercup. Peeta, the thing I want so badly to secure, is the light. As long as Buttercup feels he has the chance of catching the elusive light under his paws, he’s bristling with aggression. (That’s how I’ve been since I left the arena, with Peeta alive.) When the light goes out completely, Buttercup’s temporarily distraught and confused, but he recovers and moves on to other things. (That’s what would happen if Peeta died.) But the one thing that sends Buttercup into a tailspin is when I leave the light on but put it hopelessly out of his reach, high on the wall, beyond even his jumping skills. He paces below the wall, wails, and can’t be comforted or distracted. He’s useless until I shut the light off. (That’s what Snow is trying to do to me now, only I don’t know what form his game takes.)<br/>Maybe this realization on my part is all Snow needs. Thinking that Peeta was in his possession and being tortured for rebel information was bad. But thinking that he’s being tortured specifically to incapacitate me is unendurable. And it’s under the weight of this revelation that I truly begin to break.<br/>After Crazy Cat, we’re directed to bed. The power’s been coming and going; sometimes the lamps burn at full brightness, other times we squint at one another in the brownouts. At bedtime they turn the lamps to near darkness and activate safety lights in each space. Prim, who’s decided the walls will hold up, snuggles with Buttercup on the lower bunk. My mother’s on the upper. I offer to take a bunk, but they make me keep to the floor mattress since I flail around so much when I’m sleeping.<br/>I’m not flailing now, as my muscles are rigid with the tension of holding myself together. The pain over my heart returns, and from it I imagine tiny fissures spreading out into my body. Through my torso, down my arms and legs, over my face, leaving it crisscrossed with cracks. One good jolt of a bunker missile and I could shatter into strange, razor-sharp shards.<br/>When the restless, wiggling majority has settled into sleep, I carefully extricate myself from my blanket and tiptoe through the cavern until I find Finnick, feeling for some unspecified reason that he will understand. He sits under the safety light in his space, knotting his rope, not even pretending to rest. As I whisper my discovery of Snow’s plan to break me, it dawns on me. This strategy is very old news to Finnick. It’s what broke him.<br/>“This is what they’re doing to you with Annie, isn’t it?” I ask.<br/>“Well, they didn’t arrest her because they thought she’d be a wealth of rebel information,” he says. “They know I’d never have risked telling her anything like that. For her own protection.”<br/>“Oh, Finnick. I’m so sorry,” I say.<br/>“No, I’m sorry. That I didn’t warn you somehow,” he tells me.<br/>Suddenly, a memory surfaces. I’m strapped to my bed, mad with rage and grief after the rescue. Finnick is trying to console me about Peeta. “They’ll figure out he doesn’t know anything pretty fast. And they won’t kill him if they think they can use him against you.”<br/>“You did warn me, though. On the hovercraft. Only when you said they’d use Peeta against me, I thought you meant like bait. To lure me into the Capitol somehow,” I say.<br/>“I shouldn’t have said even that. It was too late for it to be of any help to you. Since I hadn’t warned you before the Quarter Quell, I should’ve shut up about how Snow operates.” Finnick yanks on the end of his rope, and an intricate knot becomes a straight line again. “It’s just that I didn’t understand when I met you. After your first Games, I thought the whole romance was an act on your part. We all expected you’d continue that strategy. But it wasn’t until Peeta hit the force field and nearly died that I—” Finnick hesitates.<br/><br/>I think back to the arena. How I sobbed when Finnick revived Peeta. The quizzical look on Finnick’s face. The way he excused my behavior, blaming it on my pretend pregnancy. “That you what?”<br/>“That I knew I’d misjudged you. That you do love him. I’m not saying in what way. Maybe you don’t know yourself</td>

<td>But anyone paying attention could see how much you care about him,” he says gently.<br/>Anyone? On Snow’s visit before the Victory Tour, he challenged me to erase any doubts of my love for Peeta. “Convince me,” Snow said. It seems, under that hot pink sky with Peeta’s life in limbo, I finally did. And in doing so, I gave him the weapon he needed to break me.<br/>Finnick and I sit for a long time in silence, watching the knots bloom and vanish, before I can ask, “How do you bear it?”<br/>Finnick looks at me in disbelief. “I don’t, Katniss! Obviously, I don’t. I drag myself out of nightmares each morning and find there’s no relief in waking.” Something in my expression stops him. “Better not to give in to it. It takes ten times as long to put yourself back together as it does to fall apart.”<br/>Well, he must know. I take a deep breath, forcing myself back into one piece.<br/>“The more you can distract yourself, the better,” he says. “First thing tomorrow, we’ll get you your own rope. Until then, take mine.”<br/>I spend the rest of the night on my mattress obsessively making knots, holding them up for Buttercup’s inspection. If one looks suspicious, he swipes it out of the air and bites it a few times to make sure it’s dead. By morning, my fingers are sore, but I’m still holding on.</td>

Someone has finally broken out the coffee—although I’m sure it’s viewed only as an emergency stimulant—and Plutarch has both hands wrapped tightly around his cup as if at any moment it might be taken away.<br/>There’s no small talk. “We need all four of you suited up and aboveground,” says the president. “You have two hours to get footage showing the damage from the bombing, establish that Thirteen’s military unit remains not only functional but dominant, and, most important, that the Mockingjay is still alive. Any questions?”<br/>“Can we have a coffee?” asks Finnick.<br/>Steaming cups are handed out. I stare distastefully at the shiny black liquid, never having been much of a fan of the stuff, but thinking it might help me stay on my feet. Finnick sloshes some cream in my cup and reaches into the sugar bowl. “Want a sugar cube?” he asks in his old seductive voice. That’s how we met, with Finnick offering me sugar. Surrounded by horses and chariots, costumed and painted for the crowds, before we were allies. Before I had any idea what made him tick. The memory actually coaxes a smile out of me. “Here, it improves the taste,” he says in his real voice, plunking three cubes in my cup.<br/>As I turn to go suit up as the Mockingjay, I catch Gale watching me and Finnick unhappily. What now? Does he actually think something’s going on between us? Maybe he saw me go to Finnick’s last night. I would’ve passed the Hawthornes’ space to get there. I guess that probably rubbed him the wrong way. Me seeking out Finnick’s company instead of his. Well, fine. I’ve got rope burn on my fingers, I can barely hold my eyes open, and a camera crew’s waiting for me to do something brilliant. And Snow’s got Peeta. Gale can think whatever he wants.</td>

So I didn’t imagine it. The rose on my dresser. Before me lies Snow’s second delivery. Long-stemmed pink and red beauties, the very flowers that decorated the set where Peeta and I performed our post-victory interview. Flowers not meant for one, but for a pair of lovers.<br/>I explain to the others as best I can. Upon inspection, they appear to be harmless, if genetically enhanced, flowers. Two dozen roses. Slightly wilted. Most likely dropped after the last bombing. A crew in special suits collects them and carts them away. I feel certain they will find nothing extraordinary in them, though.

But not his death, no, nothing so merciful as that. Snow will ensure that his life is much worse than death.<br/><br/>“Cut,” I hear Cressida say quietly.<br/>“What’s wrong with her?” Plutarch says under his breath.<br/>“She’s figured out how Snow’s using Peeta,” says Finnick.<br/>There’s something like a collective sigh of regret from the semicircle of people spread out before me. Because I know this now. Because there will never be a way for me to not know this again. Because, beyond the military disadvantage losing a Mockingjay entails, I am broken.<br/>Several sets of arms would embrace me. But in the end, the only person I truly want to comfort me is Haymitch, because he loves Peeta, too. I reach out for him and say something like his name and he’s there, holding me and patting my back. “It’s okay. It’ll be okay, sweetheart.” He sits me on a length of broken marble pillar and keeps an arm around me while I sob.<br/>“I can’t do this anymore,” I say.<br/>“I know,” he says.<br/>“All I can think of is—what he’s going to do to Peeta—because I’m the Mockingjay!” I get out.<br/>“I know.” Haymitch’s arm tightens around me.<br/>“Did you see? How weird he acted? What are they—doing to him?” I’m gasping for air between sobs, but I manage one last phrase. “It’s my fault!” And then I cross some line into hysteria and there’s a needle in my arm and the world slips away.<br/>It must be strong, whatever they shot into me, because it’s a full day before I come to. My sleep wasn’t peaceful, though. I have the sense of emerging from a world of dark, haunted places where I traveled alone. Haymitch sits in the chair by my bed, his skin waxen, his eyes bloodshot. I remember about Peeta and start to tremble again.<br/>Haymitch reaches out and squeezes my shoulder. “It’s all right. We’re going to try to get Peeta out.”<br/>“What?” That makes no sense.<br/>“Plutarch’s sending in a rescue team. He has people on the inside. He thinks we can get Peeta back alive,” he says.<br/>“Why didn’t we before?” I say.<br/>“Because it’s costly. But everyone agrees this is the thing to do. It’s the same choice we made in the arena. To do whatever it takes to keep you going. We can’t lose the Mockingjay now. And you can’t perform unless you know Snow can’t take it out on Peeta.” Haymitch offers me a cup. “Here, drink something.”<br/>I slowly sit up and take a sip of water. “What do you mean, costly?”<br/>He shrugs. “Covers will be blown. People may die. But keep in mind that they’re dying every day. And it’s not just Peeta; we’re getting Annie out for Finnick, too.”<br/>“Where is he?” I ask.<br/>“Behind that screen, sleeping his sedative off. He lost it right after we knocked you out,” says Haymitch. I smile a little, feel a bit less weak. “Yeah, it was a really excellent shoot. You two cracked up and Boggs left to arrange the mission to get Peeta. We’re officially in reruns.”<br/>“Well, if Boggs is leading it, that’s a plus,” I say.<br/>“Oh, he’s on top of it. It was volunteer only, but he pretended not to notice me waving my hand in the air,” says Haymitch. “See? He’s already demonstrated good judgment.”<br/><br/>Something’s wrong. Haymitch’s trying a little too hard to cheer me up. It’s not really his style. “So who else volunteered?”<br/>“I think there were seven altogether,” he says evasively.<br/>I get a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach. “Who else, Haymitch?” I insist.<br/>Haymitch finally drops the good-natured act. “You know who else, Katniss.

A pale gray nothingness that is all my future holds.<br/>“Do you want me to have them sedate you until it’s over?” asks Haymitch. He’s not joking. This is a man who spent his adult life at the bottom of a bottle, trying to anesthetize himself against the Capitol’s crimes. The sixteen-year-old boy who won the second Quarter Quell must have had people he loved—family, friends, a sweetheart maybe—that he fought to get back to. Where are they now?

Although it’s cowardly—cruel even—to rouse him from the shadowy, muted drug land to stark reality, I go ahead and do it because I can’t stand to face this by myself.<br/>As I explain our situation, his initial agitation mysteriously ebbs. “Don’t you see, Katniss, this will decide things. One way or the other. By the end of the day, they’ll either be dead or with us. It’s…it’s more than we could hope for!”<br/>Well, that’s a sunny view of our situation. And yet there’s something calming about the idea that this torment could come to an end.<br/>The curtain yanks back and there’s Haymitch. He has a job for us, if we can pull it together. They still need post-bombing footage of 13. “If we can get it in the next few hours, Beetee can air it leading up to the rescue, and maybe keep the Capitol’s attention elsewhere.”<br/><br/>“Yes, a distraction,” says Finnick. “A decoy of sorts.”<br/>“What we really need is something so riveting that even President Snow won’t be able to tear himself away. Got anything like that?” asks Haymitch.<br/>Having a job that might help the mission snaps me into focus. While I knock down breakfast and get prepped, I try to think of what I might say. President Snow must be wondering how that blood-splattered floor and his roses are affecting me. If he wants me broken, then I will have to be whole. But I don’t think I will convince him of anything by shouting a couple of defiant lines at the camera. Besides, that won’t buy the rescue team any time. Outbursts are short. It’s stories that take time.<br/>I don’t know if it will work, but when the television crew’s all assembled aboveground, I ask Cressida if she could start out by asking me about Peeta. I take a seat on the fallen marble pillar where I had my breakdown, wait for the red light and Cressida’s question.<br/>“How did you meet Peeta?” she asks.<br/>And then I do the thing that Haymitch has wanted since my first interview. I open up. “When I met Peeta, I was eleven years old, and I was almost dead.” I talk about that awful day when I tried to sell the baby clothes in the rain, how Peeta’s mother chased me from the bakery door, and how he took a beating to bring me the loaves of bread that saved our lives. “We had never even spoken. The first time I ever talked to Peeta was on the train to the Games.”<br/><br/></td>

But Finnick Odair takes a completely different tack.<br/>“President Snow used to…sell me…my body, that is,” Finnick begins in a flat, removed tone. “I wasn’t the only one. If a victor is considered desirable, the president gives them as a reward or allows people to buy them for an exorbitant amount of money. If you refuse, he kills someone you love. So you do it.”<br/>That explains it, then. Finnick’s parade of lovers in the Capitol. They were never real lovers. Just people like our old Head Peacekeeper, Cray, who bought desperate girls to devour and discard because he could. I want to interrupt the taping and beg Finnick’s forgiveness for every false thought I’ve ever had about him. But we have a job to do, and I sense Finnick’s role will be far more effective than mine.<br/>“I wasn’t the only one, but I was the most popular,” he says. “And perhaps the most defenseless, because the people I loved were so defenseless. To make themselves feel better, my patrons would make presents of money or jewelry, but I found a much more valuable form of payment.”<br/>Secrets, I think. That’s what Finnick told me his lovers paid him in, only I thought the whole arrangement was by his choice.<br/>“Secrets,” he says, echoing my thoughts. “And this is where you’re going to want to stay tuned, President Snow, because so very many of them were about you. But let’s begin with some of the others.”<br/><br/>Finnick begins to weave a tapestry so rich in detail that you can’t doubt its authenticity. Tales of strange sexual appetites, betrayals of the heart, bottomless greed, and bloody power plays. Drunken secrets whispered over damp pillow-cases in the dead of night. Finnick was someone bought and sold. A district slave. A handsome one, certainly, but in reality, harmless. Who would he tell? And who would believe him if he did? But some secrets are too delicious not to share. I don’t know the people Finnick names—all seem to be prominent Capitol citizens—but I know, from listening to the chatter of my prep team, the attention the most mild slip in judgment can draw. If a bad haircut can lead to hours of gossip, what will charges of incest, back-stabbing, blackmail, and arson produce? Even as the waves of shock and recrimination roll over the Capitol, the people there will be waiting, as I am now, to hear about the president.<br/></td>

<td>“And now, on to our good President Coriolanus Snow,” says Finnick. “Such a young man when he rose to power. Such a clever one to keep it. How, you must ask yourself, did he do it? One word. That’s all you really need to know. Poison.” Finnick goes back to Snow’s political ascension, which I know nothing of, and works his way up to the present, pointing out case after case of the mysterious deaths of Snow’s adversaries or, even worse, his allies who had the potential to become threats. People dropping dead at a feast or slowly, inexplicably declining into shadows over a period of months. Blamed on bad shellfish, elusive viruses, or an overlooked weakness in the aorta. Snow drinking from the poisoned cup himself to deflect suspicion. But antidotes don’t always work. They say that’s why he wears the roses that reek of perfume. They say it’s to cover the scent of blood from the mouth sores that will never heal. They say, they say, they say…Snow has a list and no one knows who will be next.<br/>Poison. The perfect weapon for a snake.<br/>Since my opinion of the Capitol and its noble president are already so low, I can’t say Finnick’s allegations shock me. They seem to have far more effect on the displaced Capitol rebels like my crew and Fulvia—even Plutarch occasionally reacts in surprise, maybe wondering how a specific tidbit passed him by. When Finnick finishes, they just keep the cameras rolling until finally he has to be the one to say “Cut.”<br/></td>

I’m left with Haymitch in the rubble, wondering if Finnick’s fate would have one day been mine. Why not? Snow could have gotten a really good price for the girl on fire.<br/>“Is that what happened to you?” I ask Haymitch.<br/>“No. My mother and younger brother. My girl. They were all dead two weeks after I was crowned victor. Because of that stunt I pulled with the force field,” he answers. “Snow had no one to use against me.”<br/>“I’m surprised he didn’t just kill you,” I say.<br/>“Oh, no. I was the example. The person to hold up to the young Finnicks and Johannas and Cashmeres. Of what could happen to a victor who caused problems,” says Haymitch. “But he knew he had no leverage against me.”<br/>“Until Peeta and I came along,” I say softly.

<td>At 15:00, the designated hour, we stand tense and silent in the back of a room full of screens and computers and watch Beetee and his team try to dominate the airwaves. His usual fidgety distraction is replaced with a determination I have never seen. Most of my interview doesn’t make the cut, just enough to show I am alive and still defiant. It is Finnick’s salacious and gory account of the Capitol that takes the day. Is Beetee’s skill improving? Or are his counterparts in the Capitol a little too fascinated to want to tune Finnick out? For the next sixty minutes, the Capitol feed alternates between the standard afternoon newscast, Finnick, and attempts to black it all out. But the rebel techno team manages to override even the latter and, in a real coup, keeps control for almost the entire attack on Snow.<br/>“Let it go!” says Beetee, throwing up his hands, relinquishing the broadcast back to the Capitol. He mops his face with a cloth. “If they’re not out of there by now, they’re all dead.” He spins in his chair to see Finnick and me reacting to his words. “It was a good plan, though. Did Plutarch show it to you?”<br/><br/>Of course not. Beetee takes us to another room and shows us how the team, with the help of rebel insiders, will attempt—has attempted—to free the victors from an underground prison. It seems to have involved knockout gas distributed by the ventilation system, a power failure, the detonation of a bomb in a government building several miles from the prison, and now the disruption of the broadcast. Beetee’s glad we find the plan hard to follow, because then our enemies will, too.</td>

Do not think of Peeta. Making knots. We do not want dinner. Fingers raw and bleeding. Finnick finally gives up and assumes the hunched position he took in the arena when the jabberjays attacked. I perfect my miniature noose. The words of “The Hanging Tree” replay in my head. Gale and Peeta. Peeta and Gale.<br/>“Did you love Annie right away, Finnick?” I ask.<br/>“No.” A long time passes before he adds, “She crept up on me.”<br/><br/>I search my heart, but at the moment the only person I can feel creeping up on me is Snow.<br/>It must be midnight, it must be tomorrow when Haymitch pushes open the door. “They’re back. We’re wanted in the hospital.” My mouth opens with a flood of questions that he cuts off with “That’s all I know.”<br/>I want to run, but Finnick’s acting so strange, as if he’s lost the ability to move, so I take his hand and lead him like a small child.

<td>So, Katniss, Peeta’s condition has come as a shock to all of us,” says Plutarch. “We couldn’t help but notice his deterioration in the last two interviews. Obviously, he’d been abused, and we put his psychological state down to that. Now we believe something more was going on. That the Capitol has been subjecting him to a rather uncommon technique known as hijacking. Beetee?”<br/>“I’m sorry,” Beetee says, “but I can’t tell you all the specifics of it, Katniss. The Capitol’s very secretive about this form of torture, and I believe the results are inconsistent. This we do know. It’s a type of fear conditioning. The term hijack comes from an old English word that means ‘to capture,’ or even better, ‘seize.’ We believe it was chosen because the technique involves the use of tracker jacker venom, and the jack suggested hijack. You were stung in your first Hunger Games, so unlike most of us, you have firsthand knowledge of the effects of the venom.”<br/>Terror. Hallucinations. Nightmarish visions of losing those I love. Because the venom targets the part of the brain that houses fear.<br/>“I’m sure you remember how frightening it was. Did you also suffer mental confusion in the aftermath?” asks Beetee. “A sense of being unable to judge what was true and what was false? Most people who have been stung and lived to tell about it report something of the kind.”<br/>Yes. That encounter with Peeta. Even after I was clearheaded, I wasn’t sure if he had saved my life by taking on Cato or if I’d imagined it.<br/>“Recall is made more difficult because memories can be changed.” Beetee taps his forehead. “Brought to the forefront of your mind, altered, and saved again in the revised form. Now imagine that I ask you to remember something—either with a verbal suggestion or by making you watch a tape of the event—and while that experience is refreshed, I give you a dose of tracker jacker venom. Not enough to induce a three-day blackout. Just enough to infuse the memory with fear and doubt. And that’s what your brain puts in long-term storage.”<br/>I start to feel sick. Prim asks the question that’s in my mind. “Is that what they’ve done to Peeta? Taken his memories of Katniss and distorted them so they’re scary?”<br/>Beetee nods. “So scary that he’d see her as life-threatening. That he might try to kill her. Yes, that’s our current theory.”<br/>I cover my face with my arms because this isn’t happening. It isn’t possible. For someone to make Peeta forget he loves me…no one could do that.<br/>“But you can reverse it, right?” asks Prim.<br/>“Um…very little data on that,” says Plutarch. “None, really. If hijacking rehabilitation has been attempted before, we have no access to those records.”<br/>“Well, you’re going to try, aren’t you?” Prim persists. “You’re not just going to lock him up in some padded room and leave him to suffer?”<br/>“Of course, we’ll try, Prim,” says Beetee. “It’s just, we don’t know to what degree we’ll succeed. If any. My guess is that fearful events are the hardest to root out. They’re the ones we naturally remember the best, after all.”<br/>“And apart from his memories of Katniss, we don’t yet know what else has been tampered with,” says Plutarch. “We’re putting together a team of mental health and military professionals to come up with a counterattack. I, personally, feel optimistic that he’ll make a full recovery.”<br/></td>

He’s exhausted and discouraged as he admits, “I think Peeta might get somewhat better. But…I don’t think he’ll ever be the same.” I snap my arms back together, closing the crack, shutting them all out.<br/>“At least he’s alive,” says Plutarch, as if he’s losing patience with the lot of us. “Snow executed Peeta’s stylist and his prep team on live television tonight. We’ve no idea what happened to Effie Trinket. Peeta’s damaged, but he’s here. With us. And that’s a definite improvement over his situation twelve hours ago. Let’s keep that in mind, all right?”<br/>Plutarch’s attempt to cheer me up—laced with the news of another four, possibly five, murders—somehow backfires. Portia. Peeta’s prep team. Effie. The effort to fight back tears makes my throat throb until I’m gasping again. Eventually, they have no choice but to sedate me.<br/>When I wake, I wonder if this will be the only way I sleep now, with drugs shot into my arm. I’m glad I’m not supposed to talk for the next few days, because there’s nothing I want to say. Or do. In fact, I’m a model patient, my lethargy taken for restraint, obedience to the doctors’ orders. I no longer feel like crying. In fact, I can only manage to hold on to one simple thought: an image of Snow’s face accompanied by the whisper in my head. I will kill you.</td>

There’s a chance that the old Peeta, the one who loves you, is still inside. Trying to get back to you.

<td>Versions of the picture litter the table and floor. Tacked on the corkboard walls and occupying several computer screens are other designs of some sort. In the rough lines of one, I recognize Gale’s twitch-up snare. “What are these?” I ask hoarsely, pulling their attention from the sheet.<br/>“Ah, Katniss, you’ve found us out,” says Beetee cheerfully.<br/>“What? Is this a secret?” I know Gale’s been down here working with Beetee a lot, but I assumed they were messing around with bows and guns.<br/>“Not really. But I’ve felt a little guilty about it. Stealing Gale away from you so much,” Beetee admits.<br/>Since I’ve spent most of my time in 13 disoriented, worried, angry, being remade, or hospitalized, I can’t say Gale’s absences have inconvenienced me. Things haven’t been exactly harmonious between us, either. But I let Beetee think he owes me. “I hope you’ve been putting his time to good use.”<br/>“Come and see,” he says, waving me over to a computer screen.<br/>This is what they’ve been doing. Taking the fundamental ideas behind Gale’s traps and adapting them into weapons against humans. Bombs mostly. It’s less about the mechanics of the traps than the psychology behind them. Booby-trapping an area that provides something essential to survival. A water or food supply. Frightening prey so that a large number flee into a greater destruction. Endangering off-spring in order to draw in the actual desired target, the parent. Luring the victim into what appears to be a safe haven—where death awaits it. At some point, Gale and Beetee left the wilderness behind and focused on more human impulses. Like compassion. A bomb explodes. Time is allowed for people to rush to the aid of the wounded. Then a second, more powerful bomb kills them as well.<br/>“That seems to be crossing some kind of line,” I say. “So anything goes?” They both stare at me—Beetee with doubt, Gale with hostility. “I guess there isn’t a rule book for what might be unacceptable to do to another human being.”<br/>“Sure there is. Beetee and I have been following the same rule book President Snow used when he hijacked Peeta,” says Gale.<br/>Cruel, but to the point. I leave without further comment. I feel if I don’t get outside immediately, I’ll just go ballistic, but I’m still in Special Defense when I’m waylaid by Haymitch. “Come on,” he says. “We need you back up at the hospital.”<br/>“What for?” I ask.<br/>“They’re going to try something on Peeta,” he answers. “Send in the most innocuous person from Twelve they can come up with. Find someone Peeta might share childhood memories with, but nothing too close to you. They’re screening people now.”<br/>I know this will be a difficult task, since anyone Peeta shares childhood memories with would most likely be from town, and almost none of those people escaped the flames. But when we reach the hospital room that has been turned into a work space for Peeta’s recovery team, there she sits chatting with Plutarch. Delly Cartwright. As always, she gives me a smile that suggests I’m her best friend in the world. She gives this smile to everyone. “Katniss!” she calls out.<br/>“Hey, Delly,” I say. I’d heard she and her younger brother had survived. Her parents, who ran the shoe shop in town, weren’t as lucky. She looks older, wearing the drab 13 clothes that flatter no one, with her long yellow hair in a practical braid instead of curls. Delly’s a bit thinner than I remember, but she was one of the few kids in District 12 with a couple of pounds to spare. The diet here, the stress, the grief of losing her parents have all, no doubt, contributed. “How are you doing?” I ask.<br/>“Oh, it’s been a lot of changes all at once.” Her eyes fill with tears. “But everyone’s really nice here in Thirteen, don’t you think?”<br/>Delly means it. She genuinely likes people. All people, not just a select few she’s spent years making up her mind about.<br/>“They’ve made an effort to make us feel welcome,” I say. I think that’s a fair statement without going overboard. “Are you the one they’ve picked to see Peeta?”<br/>“I guess so. Poor Peeta. Poor you. I’ll never understand the Capitol,” she says.<br/>“Better not to, maybe,” I tell her.</td>

I used to tell people he was my brother.”<br/>“What do you think?” Haymitch asks me. “Anything that might trigger memories of you?”<br/><br/>“We were all in the same class. But we never overlapped much,” I say.<br/>“Katniss was always so amazing, I never dreamed she would notice me,” says Delly. “The way she could hunt and go in the Hob and everything. Everyone admired her so.”<br/>Haymitch and I both have to take a hard look at her face to double-check if she’s joking. To hear Delly describe it, I had next to no friends because I intimidated people by being so exceptional. Not true. I had next to no friends because I wasn’t friendly. Leave it to Delly to spin me into something wonderful.<br/>“Delly always thinks the best of everyone,” I explain. “I don’t think Peeta could have bad memories associated with her.” Then I remember. “Wait. In the Capitol. When I lied about recognizing the Avox girl. Peeta covered for me and said she looked like Delly.”<br/>“I remember,” says Haymitch. “But I don’t know. It wasn’t true. Delly wasn’t actually there. I don’t think it can compete with years of childhood memories.”<br/>“Especially with such a pleasant companion as Delly,” says Plutarch. “Let’s give it a shot.”<br/></td>

<td>By the other districts’ standards, the Capitol babied the inhabitants here. Just by looking at the District 2 rebels, you can tell they were decently fed and cared for in childhood. Some did end up as quarry and mine workers. Others were educated for jobs in the Nut or funneled into the ranks of Peacekeepers. Trained young and hard for combat. The Hunger Games were an opportunity for wealth and a kind of glory not seen elsewhere. Of course, the people of 2 swallowed the Capitol’s propaganda more easily than the rest of us. Embraced their ways. But for all that, at the end of the day, they were still slaves. And if that was lost on the citizens who became Peacekeepers or worked in the Nut, it was not lost on the stonecutters who formed the backbone of the resistance here.</td>

Its few entrances heavily fortified, its heart safely enfolded in the mountain. While every other district has now wrested control from the Capitol, 2 remains in its pocket.<br/>Each day, I do whatever I can to help. Visit the wounded. Tape short propos with my camera crew. I’m not allowed in actual combat, but they invite me to the meetings on the status of the war, which is a lot more than they did in 13. It’s much better here. Freer, no schedules on my arm, fewer demands on my time. I live aboveground in the rebel villages or surrounding caves. For safety’s sake, I’m relocated often. During the day, I’ve been given clearance to hunt as long as I take a guard along and don’t stray too far. In the thin, cold mountain air, I feel some physical strength returning, my mind clearing away the rest of the fogginess. But with this mental clarity comes an even sharper awareness of what has been done to Peeta.<br/>Snow has stolen him from me, twisted him beyond recognition, and made me a present of him. Boggs, who came to 2 when I did, told me that even with all the plotting, it was a little too easy to rescue Peeta. He believes if 13 hadn’t made the effort, Peeta would’ve been delivered to me anyway. Dropped off in an actively warring district or perhaps 13 itself. Tied up with ribbons and tagged with my name. Programmed to murder me.<br/>It’s only now that he’s been corrupted that I can fully appreciate the real Peeta. Even more than I would’ve if he’d died. The kindness, the steadiness, the warmth that had an unexpected heat behind it. Outside of Prim, my mother, and Gale, how many people in the world love me unconditionally? I think in my case, the answer may now be none. Sometimes when I’m alone, I take the pearl from where it lives in my pocket and try to remember the boy with the bread, the strong arms that warded off nightmares on the train, the kisses in the arena. To make myself put a name to the thing I’ve lost. But what’s the use? It’s gone. He’s gone. Whatever existed between us is gone. All that’s left is my promise to kill Snow.

His lips brushing the faded bruises on my neck, working their way to my mouth. Despite what I feel for Peeta, this is when I accept deep down that he’ll never come back to me.

My hand automatically goes to the scar on my left temple, which I associate with confusion. “Now kiss me.” Bewildered, unblinking, I stand there while he leans in and presses his lips to mine briefly. He examines my face closely. “What’s going on in your head?”<br/>“I don’t know,” I whisper back.<br/>“Then it’s like kissing someone who’s drunk. It doesn’t count,” he says with a weak attempt at a laugh. He scoops up a pile of kindling and drops it in my empty arms, returning me to myself.<br/>“How do you know?” I say, mostly to cover my embarrassment. “Have you kissed someone who’s drunk?” I guess Gale could’ve been kissing girls right and left back in 12. He certainly had enough takers. I never thought about it much before.<br/>He just shakes his head. “No. But it’s not hard to imagine.”<br/>“So, you never kissed any other girls?” I ask.<br/>“I didn’t say that. You know, you were only twelve when we met. And a real pain besides. I did have a life outside of hunting with you,” he says, loading up with firewood.<br/>Suddenly, I’m genuinely curious. “Who did you kiss? And where?”<br/>“Too many to remember. Behind the school, on the slag heap, you name it,” he says.<br/>I roll my eyes. “So when did I become so special? When they carted me off to the Capitol?”<br/>“No. About six months before that. Right after New Year’s. We were in the Hob, eating some slop of Greasy Sae’s. And Darius was teasing you about trading a rabbit for one of his kisses. And I realized…I minded,” he tells me.<br/>I remember that day. Bitter cold and dark by four in the afternoon. We’d been hunting, but a heavy snow had driven us back into town. The Hob was crowded with people looking for refuge from the weather. Greasy Sae’s soup, made with stock from the bones of a wild dog we’d shot a week earlier, was below her usual standards. Still, it was hot, and I was starving as I scooped it up, sitting cross-legged on her counter. Darius was leaning on the post of the stall, tickling my cheek with the end of my braid, while I smacked his hand away. He was explaining why one of his kisses merited a rabbit, or possibly two, since everyone knows redheaded men are the most virile. And Greasy Sae and I were laughing because he was so ridiculous and persistent and kept pointing out women around the Hob who he said had paid far more than a rabbit to enjoy his lips. “See? The one in the green muffler? Go ahead and ask her. If you need a reference.”<br/>A million miles from here, a billion days ago, this happened. “Darius was just joking around,” I say.<br/>“Probably. Although you’d be the last to figure out if he wasn’t,” Gale tells me. “Take Peeta. Take me. Or even Finnick. I was starting to worry he had his eye on you, but he seems back on track now.”<br/>“You don’t know Finnick if you think he’d love me,” I say.<br/>Gale shrugs. “I know he was desperate. That makes people do all kinds of crazy</td>

<td>The commander from 2, a middle-aged woman named Lyme, takes us on a virtual tour of the Nut, its interior and fortifications, and recounts the failed attempts to seize it. I’ve crossed paths with her briefly a couple of times since my arrival, and was dogged by the feeling I’d met her before. She’s memorable enough, standing over six feet tall and heavily muscled. But it’s only when I see a clip of her in the field, leading a raid on the main entrance of the Nut, that something clicks and I realize I’m in the presence of another victor. Lyme, the tribute from District 2, who won her Hunger Games over a generation ago. Effie sent us her tape, among others, to prepare for the Quarter Quell. I’ve probably caught glimpses of her during the Games over the years, but she’s kept a low profile. With my newfound knowledge of Haymitch’s and Finnick’s treatment, all I can think is: What did the Capitol do to her after she won?<br/></td>

<td>Gale, who is too restless to sit at the table for more than a few hours, has been alternating between pacing and sharing my windowsill. Early on, he seemed to accept Lyme’s assertion that the entrances couldn’t be taken, and dropped out of the conversation entirely. For the last hour or so, he’s sat quietly, his brow knitted in concentration, staring at the Nut through the window glass. In the silence that follows Lyme’s ultimatum, he speaks up. “Is it really so necessary that we take the Nut? Or would it be enough to disable it?”<br/>“That would be a step in the right direction,” says Beetee. “What do you have in mind?”<br/>“Think of it as a wild dog den,” Gale continues. “You’re not going to fight your way in. So you have two choices. Trap the dogs inside or flush them out.”<br/>“We’ve tried bombing the entrances,” says Lyme. “They’re set too far inside the stone for any real damage to be done.”<br/>“I wasn’t thinking of that,” says Gale. “I was thinking of using the mountain.” Beetee rises and joins Gale at the window, peering through his ill-fitting glasses. “See? Running down the sides?”<br/>“Avalanche paths,” says Beetee under his breath. “It’d be tricky. We’d have to design the detonation sequence with great care, and once it’s in motion, we couldn’t hope to control it.”<br/>“We don’t need to control it if we give up the idea that we have to possess the Nut,” says Gale. “Only shut it down.”<br/>“So you’re suggesting we start avalanches and block the entrances?” asks Lyme.<br/>“That’s it,” says Gale. “Trap the enemy inside, cut off from supplies. Make it impossible for them to send out their hovercraft.”<br/>While everyone considers the plan, Boggs flips through a stack of blueprints of the Nut and frowns. “You risk killing everyone inside. Look at the ventilation system. It’s rudimentary at best. Nothing like what we have in Thirteen. It depends entirely on pumping in air from the mountainsides. Block those vents and you’ll suffocate whoever is trapped.”<br/>“They could still escape through the train tunnel to the square,” says Beetee.<br/>“Not if we blow it up,” says Gale brusquely. His intent, his full intent, becomes clear. Gale has no interest in preserving the lives of those in the Nut. No interest in caging the prey for later use.<br/>This is one of his death traps.</td>

<td>The implications of what Gale is suggesting settle quietly around the room. You can see the reaction playing out on people’s faces. The expressions range from pleasure to distress, from sorrow to satisfaction.<br/>“The majority of the workers are citizens from Two,” says Beetee neutrally.<br/>“So what?” says Gale. “We’ll never be able to trust them again.”<br/>“They should at least have a chance to surrender,” says Lyme.<br/>“Well, that’s a luxury we weren’t given when they fire-bombed Twelve, but you’re all so much cozier with the Capitol here,” says Gale. By the look on Lyme’s face, I think she might shoot him, or at least take a swing. She’d probably have the upper hand, too, with all her training. But her anger only seems to infuriate him and he yells, “We watched children burn to death and there was nothing we could do!”<br/>I have to close my eyes a minute, as the image rips through me. It has the desired effect. I want everyone in that mountain dead. Am about to say so. But then…I’m also a girl from District 12. Not President Snow. I can’t help it. I can’t condemn someone to the death he’s suggesting. “Gale,” I say, taking his arm and trying to speak in a reasonable tone. “The Nut’s an old mine. It’d be like causing a massive coal mining accident.” Surely the words are enough to make anyone from 12 think twice about the plan.<br/>“But not so quick as the one that killed our fathers,” he retorts. “Is that everyone’s problem? That our enemies might have a few hours to reflect on the fact that they’re dying, instead of just being blown to bits?”<br/>Back in the old days, when we were nothing more than a couple of kids hunting outside of 12, Gale said things like this and worse. But then they were just words. Here, put into practice, they become deeds that can never be reversed.<br/>“You don’t know how those District Two people ended up in the Nut,” I say. “They may have been coerced. They may be held against their will. Some are our own spies. Will you kill them, too?”<br/>“I would sacrifice a few, yes, to take out the rest of them,” he replies. “And if I were a spy in there, I’d say, ‘Bring on the avalanches!’”<br/>I know he’s telling the truth. That Gale would sacrifice his life in this way for the cause—no one doubts it. Perhaps we’d all do the same if we were the spies and given the choice. I guess I would. But it’s a coldhearted decision to make for other people and those who love them.<br/>“You said we had two choices,” Boggs tells him. “To trap them or to flush them out. I say we try to avalanche the mountain but leave the train tunnel alone. People can escape into the square, where we’ll be waiting for them.”<br/>“Heavily armed, I hope,” says Gale. “You can be sure they’ll be.”<br/>“Heavily armed. We’ll take them prisoner,” agrees Boggs.<br/>“Let’s bring Thirteen into the loop now,” Beetee suggests. “Let President Coin weigh in.”<br/>“She’ll want to block the tunnel,” says Gale with conviction.<br/>“Yes, most likely. But you know, Peeta did have a point in his propos. About the dangers of killing ourselves off. I’ve been playing with some numbers. Factoring in the casualties and the wounded and…I think it’s at least worth a conversation,” says Beetee.<br/>Only a handful of people are invited to be part of that conversation. Gale and I are released with the rest. I take him hunting so he can blow off some steam, but he’s not talking about it. Probably too angry with me for countering him.<br/>The call does happen, a decision is made, and by evening I’m suited up in my Mockingjay outfit, with my bow slung over my shoulder and an earpiece that connects me to Haymitch in 13—just in case a good opportunity for a propo arises. We wait on the roof of the Justice Building with a clear view of our target.<br/>Our hoverplanes are initially ignored by the commanders in the Nut, because in the past they’ve been little more trouble than flies buzzing around a honeypot. But after two rounds of bombings in the higher elevations of the mountain, the planes have their attention. By the time the Capitol’s antiaircraft weapons begin to fire, it’s already too late.<br/>Gale’s plan exceeds anyone’s expectations. Beetee was right about being unable to control the avalanches once they’d been set in motion. The mountainsides are naturally unstable, but weakened by the explosions, they seem almost fluid. Whole sections of the Nut collapse before our eyes, obliterating any sign that human beings have ever set foot on the place. We stand speechless, tiny and insignificant, as waves of stone thunder down the mountain. Burying the entrances under tons of rock. Raising a cloud of dirt and debris that blackens the sky. Turning the Nut into a tomb.<br/>I imagine the hell inside the mountain. Sirens wailing. Lights flickering into darkness. Stone dust choking the air. The shrieks of panicked, trapped beings stumbling madly for a way out, only to find the entrances, the launchpad, the ventilation shafts themselves clogged with earth and rock trying to force its way in. Live wires flung free, fires breaking out, rubble making a familiar path a maze. People slamming, shoving, scrambling like ants as the hill presses in, threatening to crush their fragile shells.<br/></td>

<td>Katniss?” Haymitch’s voice is in my earpiece. I try to answer back and find both of my hands are clamped tightly over my mouth. “Katniss!”<br/>On the day my father died, the sirens went off during my school lunch. No one waited for dismissal, or was expected to. The response to a mine accident was something outside the control of even the Capitol. I ran to Prim’s class. I still remember her, tiny at seven, very pale, but sitting straight up with her hands folded on her desk. Waiting for me to collect her as I’d promised I would if the sirens ever sounded. She sprang out of her seat, grabbed my coat sleeve, and we wove through the streams of people pouring out onto the streets to pool at the main entrance of the mine. We found our mother clenching the rope that had been hastily strung to keep the crowd back. In retrospect, I guess I should have known there was a problem right then. Because why were we looking for her, when the reverse should have been true?<br/>The elevators were screeching, burning up and down their cables as they vomited smoke-blackened miners into the light of day. With each group came cries of relief, relatives diving under the rope to lead off their husbands, wives, children, parents, siblings. We stood in the freezing air as the afternoon turned overcast, a light snow dusted the earth. The elevators moved more slowly now and disgorged fewer beings. I knelt on the ground and pressed my hands into the cinders, wanting so badly to pull my father free. If there’s a more helpless feeling than trying to reach someone you love who’s trapped underground, I don’t know it. The wounded. The bodies. The waiting through the night. Blankets put around your shoulders by strangers. A mug of something hot that you don’t drink. And then finally, at dawn, the grieved expression on the face of the mine captain that could only mean one thing.<br/><br/>What did we just do?<br/>“Katniss! Are you there?” Haymitch is probably making plans to have me fitted for a head shackle at this very moment.</td>

It isn’t better. But I don’t really have any choice but to listen. “We showed him that clip of you singing ‘The Hanging Tree.’ It was never aired, so the Capitol couldn’t use it when he was being hijacked. He says he recognized the song.”<br/>For a moment, my heart skips a beat. Then I realize it’s just more tracker jacker serum confusion. “He couldn’t, Haymitch. He never heard me sing that song.”<br/>“Not you. Your father. He heard him singing it one day when he came to trade at the bakery. Peeta was small, probably six or seven, but he remembered it because he was specially listening to see if the birds stopped singing,” says Haymitch. “Guess they did.”<br/>Six or seven. That would have been before my mother banned the song. Maybe even right around the time I was learning it. “Was I there, too?”<br/>“Don’t think so. No mention of you anyway. But it’s the first connection to you that hasn’t triggered some mental meltdown,” says Haymitch. “It’s something, at least, Katniss.”<br/>My father. He seems to be everywhere today. Dying in the mine. Singing his way into Peeta’s muddled consciousness. Flickering in the look Boggs gives me as he protectively wraps the blanket around my shoulders.

<td>People of District Two, this is Katniss Everdeen speaking to you from the steps of your Justice Building, where—”<br/>The pair of trains comes screeching into the train station side by side. As the doors slide open, people tumble out in a cloud of smoke they’ve brought from the Nut. They must have had at least an inkling of what would await them at the square, because you can see them trying to act evasively. Most of them flatten on the floor, and a spray of bullets inside the station takes out the lights. They’ve come armed, as Gale predicted, but they’ve come wounded as well. The moans can be heard in the otherwise silent night air.<br/>Someone kills the lights on the stairs, leaving me in the protection of shadow. A flame blooms inside the station—one of the trains must actually be on fire—and a thick, black smoke billows against the windows. Left with no choice, the people begin to push out into the square, choking but defiantly waving their guns. My eyes dart around the rooftops that ring the square. Every one of them has been fortified with rebel-manned machine gun nests. Moonlight glints off oiled barrels.<br/>A young man staggers out from the station, one hand pressed against a bloody cloth at his cheek, the other dragging a gun. When he trips and falls to his face, I see the scorch marks down the back of his shirt, the red flesh beneath. And suddenly, he’s just another burn victim from a mine accident.<br/>My feet fly down the steps and I take off running for him. “Stop!” I yell at the rebels. “Hold your fire!” The words echo around the square and beyond as the mike amplifies my voice. “Stop!” I’m nearing the young man, reaching down to help him, when he drags himself up to his knees and trains his gun on my head.<br/>I instinctively back up a few steps, raise my bow over my head to show my intention was harmless. Now that he has both hands on his gun, I notice the ragged hole in his cheek where something—falling stone maybe—punctured the flesh. He smells of burning things, hair and meat and fuel. His eyes are crazed with pain and fear.<br/><br/>“Freeze,” Haymitch’s voice whispers in my ear. I follow his order, realizing that this is what all of District 2, all of Panem maybe, must be seeing at the moment. The Mockingjay at the mercy of a man with nothing to lose.<br/>His garbled speech is barely comprehensible. “Give me one reason I shouldn’t shoot you.”<br/>The rest of the world recedes. There’s only me looking into the wretched eyes of the man from the Nut who asks for one reason. Surely I should be able to come up with thousands. But the words that make it to my lips are “I can’t.”<br/>Logically, the next thing that should happen is the man pulling the trigger. But he’s perplexed, trying to make sense of my words. I experience my own confusion as I realize what I’ve said is entirely true, and the noble impulse that carried me across the square is replaced by despair. “I can’t. That’s the problem, isn’t it?” I lower my bow. “We blew up your mine. You burned my district to the ground. We’ve got every reason to kill each other. So do it. Make the Capitol happy. I’m done killing their slaves for them.” I drop my bow on the ground and give it a nudge with my boot. It slides across the stone and comes to rest at his knees.<br/>“I’m not their slave,” the man mutters.<br/>“I am,” I say. “That’s why I killed Cato…and he killed Thresh…and he killed Clove…and she tried to kill me. It just goes around and around, and who wins? Not us. Not the districts. Always the Capitol. But I’m tired of being a piece in their Games.”<br/>Peeta. On the rooftop the night before our first Hunger Games. He understood it all before we’d even set foot in the arena. I hope he’s watching now, that he remembers that night as it happened, and maybe forgives me when I die.<br/>“Keep talking. Tell them about watching the mountain go down,” Haymitch insists.<br/>“When I saw that mountain fall tonight, I thought…they’ve done it again. Got me to kill you—the people in the districts. But why did I do it? District Twelve and District Two have no fight except the one the Capitol gave us.” The young man blinks at me uncomprehendingly. I sink on my knees before him, my voice low and urgent. “And why are you fighting with the rebels on the rooftops? With Lyme, who was your victor? With people who were your neighbors, maybe even your family?”<br/>“I don’t know,” says the man. But he doesn’t take his gun off me.<br/>I rise and turn slowly in a circle, addressing the machine guns. “And you up there? I come from a mining town. Since when do miners condemn other miners to that kind of death, and then stand by to kill whoever manages to crawl from the rubble?”<br/>“Who is the enemy?” whispers Haymitch.<br/>“These people”—I indicate the wounded bodies on the square—“are not your enemy!” I whip back around to the train station. “The rebels are not your enemy! We all have one enemy, and it’s the Capitol! This is our chance to put an end to their power, but we need every district person to do it!”<br/><br/>The cameras are tight on me as I reach out my hands to the man, to the wounded, to the reluctant rebels across Panem. “Please! Join us!”<br/>My words hang in the air. I look to the screen, hoping to see them recording some wave of reconciliation going through the crowd.<br/>Instead I watch myself get shot on television.</td>

I push through cloud banks, follow faint tracks, catch the scent of cinnamon, of dill. Once I feel his hand on my cheek and try to trap it, but it dissolves like mist through my fingers.<br/>When I finally begin to surface into the sterile hospital room in 13, I remember. I was under the influence of sleep syrup. My heel had been injured after I’d climbed out on a branch over the electric fence and dropped back into 12. Peeta had put me to bed and I had asked him to stay with me as I was drifting off. He had whispered something I couldn’t quite catch.

<td>The white curtain that divides my bed from the next patient’s whips back, and Johanna Mason stares down at me. At first I feel threatened, because she attacked me in the arena. I have to remind myself that she did it to save my life. It was part of the rebel plot. But still, that doesn’t mean she doesn’t despise me. Maybe her treatment of me was all an act for the Capitol?<br/>“I’m alive,” I say rustily.<br/>“No kidding, brainless.” Johanna walks over and plunks down on my bed, sending spikes of pain shooting across my chest. When she grins at my discomfort, I know we’re not in for some warm reunion scene. “Still a little sore?” With an expert hand, she quickly detaches the morphling drip from my arm and plugs it into a socket taped into the crook of her own. “They started cutting back my supply a few days ago. Afraid I’m going to turn into one of those freaks from Six. I’ve had to borrow from you when the coast was clear. Didn’t think you’d mind.”<br/>Mind? How can I mind when she was almost tortured to death by Snow after the Quarter Quell? I have no right to mind, and she knows it.<br/>Johanna sighs as the morphling enters her bloodstream. “Maybe they were onto something in Six. Drug yourself out and paint flowers on your body. Not such a bad life. Seemed happier than the rest of us, anyway.”<br/>In the weeks since I left 13, she’s gained some weight back. A soft down of hair has sprouted on her shaved head, helping to hide some of the scars. But if she’s siphoning off my morphling, she’s struggling.<br/>“They’ve got this head doctor who comes around every day. Supposed to be helping me recover. Like some guy who’s spent his life in this rabbit warren’s going to fix me up. Complete idiot. At least twenty times a session he reminds me that I’m totally safe.” I manage a smile. It’s a truly stupid thing to say, especially to a victor. As if such a state of being ever existed, anywhere, for anyone. “How about you, Mockingjay? You feel totally safe?”<br/>“Oh, yeah. Right up until I got shot,” I say.<br/>“Please. That bullet never even touched you. Cinna saw to that,” she says.<br/>I think of the layers of protective armor in my Mockingjay outfit. But the pain came from somewhere. “Broken ribs?”<br/>“Not even. Bruised pretty good. The impact ruptured your spleen. They couldn’t repair it.” She gives a dismissive wave of her hand. “Don’t worry, you don’t need one. And if you did, they’d find you one, wouldn’t they? It’s everybody’s job to keep you alive.”<br/>“Is that why you hate me?” I ask.<br/>“Partly,” she admits. “Jealousy is certainly involved. I also think you’re a little hard to swallow. With your tacky romantic drama and your defender-of-the-helpless act. Only it isn’t an act, which makes you more unbearable. Please feel free to take this personally.”<br/>“You should have been the Mockingjay. No one would’ve had to feed you lines,” I say.<br/>“True. But no one likes me,” she tells me.<br/>“They trusted you, though. To get me out,” I remind her. “And they’re afraid of you.”<br/>“Here, maybe. In the Capitol, you’re the one they’re scared of now.” Gale</td>

I laugh, but it turns into a wince. “Easy.” He strokes my face as the pain ebbs. “You’ve got to stop running straight into trouble.”<br/>“I know.

The result is the same.”<br/>“I don’t know. We were under attack in Eight, for one thing. The hospital was under attack,” I say.<br/><br/>“Yes, and those hoverplanes came from District Two,” he says. “So, by taking them out, we prevented further attacks.”<br/>“But that kind of thinking…you could turn it into an argument for killing anyone at any time. You could justify sending kids into the Hunger Games to prevent the districts from getting out of line,” I say.<br/>“I don’t buy that,” he tells me.<br/>“I do,” I reply. “It must be those trips to the arena.”<br/>“Fine. We know how to disagree,” he says. “We always have. Maybe it’s good. Between you and me, we’ve got District Two now.”<br/>“Really?” For a moment a feeling of triumph flares up inside me. Then I think about the people on the square. “Was there fighting after I was shot?”<br/>“Not much. The workers from the Nut turned on the Capitol soldiers. The rebels just sat by and watched,” he says. “Actually, the whole country just sat by and watched.”<br/>“Well, that’s what they do best,” I say.</td>

<td>One afternoon, Plutarch joins me and gives me an update on our current situation. Now that District 2 has allied with us, the rebels are taking a breather from the war to regroup. Fortifying supply lines, seeing to the wounded, reorganizing their troops. The Capitol, like 13 during the Dark Days, finds itself completely cut off from outside help as it holds the threat of nuclear attack over its enemies. Unlike 13, the Capitol is not in a position to reinvent itself and become self-sufficient.<br/>“Oh, the city might be able to scrape along for a while,” says Plutarch. “Certainly, there are emergency supplies stockpiled. But the significant difference between Thirteen and the Capitol are the expectations of the populace. Thirteen was used to hardship, whereas in the Capitol, all they’ve known is Panem et Circenses.”<br/>“What’s that?” I recognize Panem, of course, but the rest is nonsense.<br/>“It’s a saying from thousands of years ago, written in a language called Latin about a place called Rome,” he explains. “Panem et Circenses translates into ‘Bread and Circuses.’ The writer was saying that in return for full bellies and entertainment, his people had given up their political responsibilities and therefore their power.”<br/>I think about the Capitol. The excess of food. And the ultimate entertainment. The Hunger Games. “So that’s what the districts are for. To provide the bread and circuses.”<br/>“Yes. And as long as that kept rolling in, the Capitol could control its little empire. Right now, it can provide neither, at least at the standard the people are accustomed to,” says Plutarch. “We have the food and I’m about to orchestrate an entertainment propo that’s sure to be popular. After all, everybody loves a wedding.”<br/>I freeze in my tracks, sick at the idea of what he’s suggesting. Somehow staging some perverse wedding between Peeta and me. I haven’t been able to face that one-way glass since I’ve been back and, at my own request, only get updates about Peeta’s condition from Haymitch. He speaks very little about it. Different techniques are being tried. There will never truly be a way to cure him. And now they want me to marry Peeta for a propo?<br/>Plutarch rushes to reassure me. “Oh, no, Katniss. Not your wedding. Finnick and Annie’s. All you need to do is show up and pretend to be happy for them.”<br/>“That’s one of the few things I won’t have to pretend, Plutarch,” I tell him.</td>

<td>The next few days bring a flurry of activity as the event is planned. The differences between the Capitol and 13 are thrown into sharp relief by the event. When Coin says “wedding,” she means two people signing a piece of paper and being assigned a new compartment. Plutarch means hundreds of people dressed in finery at a three-day celebration. It’s amusing to watch them haggle over the details. Plutarch has to fight for every guest, every musical note. After Coin vetoes a dinner, entertainment, and alcohol, Plutarch yells, “What’s the point of the propo if no one’s having any fun!”<br/>It’s hard to put a Gamemaker on a budget. But even a quiet celebration causes a stir in 13, where they seem to have no holidays at all. When it’s announced that children are wanted to sing District 4’s wedding song, practically every kid shows up. There’s no shortage of volunteers to help make decorations. In the dining hall, people chat excitedly about the event.<br/>Maybe it’s more than the festivities. Maybe it’s that we are all so starved for something good to happen that we want to be part of it. It would explain why—when Plutarch has a fit over what the bride will wear—I volunteer to take Annie back to my house in 12, where Cinna left a variety of evening clothes in a big storage closet downstairs. All of the wedding gowns he designed for me went back to the Capitol, but there are some dresses I wore on the Victory Tour. I’m a little leery about being with Annie since all I really know about her is that Finnick loves her and everybody thinks she’s mad. On the hovercraft ride, I decide she’s less mad than unstable. She laughs at odd places in the conversation or drops out of it distractedly. Those green eyes fixate on a point with such intensity that you find yourself trying to make out what she sees in the empty air. Sometimes, for no reason, she presses both her hands over her ears as if to block out a painful sound. All right, she’s strange, but if Finnick loves her, that’s good enough for me.<br/>I got permission for my prep team to come along, so I’m relieved of having to make any fashion decisions. When I open the closet, we all fall silent because Cinna’s presence is so strong in the flow of the fabrics. Then Octavia drops to her knees, rubs the hem of a skirt against her cheek, and bursts into tears. “It’s been so long,” she gasps, “since I’ve seen anything pretty.”<br/>Despite reservations on Coin’s side that it’s too extravagant, and on Plutarch’s side that it’s too drab, the wedding is a smash hit. The three hundred lucky guests culled from 13 and the many refugees wear their everyday clothes, the decorations are made from autumn foliage, the music is provided by a choir of children accompanied by the lone fiddler who made it out of 12 with his instrument. So it’s simple, frugal by the Capitol’s standards. It doesn’t matter because nothing can compete with the beauty of the couple. It isn’t about their borrowed finery—Annie wears a green silk dress I wore in 5, Finnick one of Peeta’s suits that they altered—although the clothes are striking. Who can look past the radiant faces of two people for whom this day was once a virtual impossibility? Dalton, the cattle guy from 10, conducts the ceremony, since it’s similar to the one used in his district. But there are unique touches of District 4. A net woven from long grass that covers the couple during their vows, the touching of each other’s lips with salt water, and the ancient wedding song, which likens marriage to a sea voyage.<br/>No, I don’t have to pretend to be happy for them.<br/>After the kiss that seals the union, the cheers, and a toast with apple cider, the fiddler strikes up a tune that turns every head from 12. We may have been the smallest, poorest district in Panem, but we know how to dance. Nothing has been officially scheduled at this point, but Plutarch, who’s calling the propo from the control room, must have his fingers crossed. Sure enough, Greasy Sae grabs Gale by the hand and pulls him into the center of the floor and faces off with him. People pour in to join them, forming two long lines. And the dancing begins.<br/>I’m standing off to the side, clapping to the rhythm, when a bony hand pinches me above the elbow. Johanna scowls at me. “Are you going to miss the chance to let Snow see you dancing?” She’s right. What could spell victory louder than a happy Mockingjay twirling around to music? I find Prim in the crowd. Since winter evenings gave us a lot of time to practice, we’re actually pretty good partners. I brush off her concerns about my ribs, and we take our places in the line. It hurts, but the satisfaction of having Snow watch me dance with my little sister reduces other feelings to dust.<br/>Dancing transforms us. We teach the steps to the District 13 guests. Insist on a special number for the bride and groom. Join hands and make a giant, spinning circle where people show off their footwork. Nothing silly, joyful, or fun has happened in so long. This could go on all night if not for the last event planned in Plutarch’s propo. One I hadn’t heard about, but then it was meant to be a surprise.</td>

<td>Four people wheel out a huge wedding cake from a side room. Most of the guests back up, making way for this rarity, this dazzling creation with blue-green, white-tipped icing waves swimming with fish and sailboats, seals and sea flowers. But I push my way through the crowd to confirm what I knew at first sight. As surely as the embroidery stitches in Annie’s gown were done by Cinna’s hand, the frosted flowers on the cake were done by Peeta’s.<br/>This may seem like a small thing, but it speaks volumes. Haymitch has been keeping a great deal from me. The boy I last saw, screaming his head off, trying to tear free of his restraints, could never have made this. Never have had the focus, kept his hands steady, designed something so perfect for Finnick and Annie. As if anticipating my reaction, Haymitch is at my side.</td>

<td>Let’s you and me have a talk,” he says.<br/>Out in the hall, away from the cameras, I ask, “What’s happening to him?”<br/>Haymitch shakes his head. “I don’t know. None of us knows. Sometimes he’s almost rational, and then, for no reason, he goes off again. Doing the cake was a kind of therapy. He’s been working on it for days. Watching him…he seemed almost like before.”<br/>“So, he’s got the run of the place?” I ask. The idea makes me nervous on about five different levels.<br/>“Oh, no. He frosted under heavy guard. He’s still under lock and key. But I’ve talked to him,” Haymitch says.<br/>“Face-to-face?” I ask. “And he didn’t go nuts?”<br/>“No. Pretty angry with me, but for all the right reasons. Not telling him about the rebel plot and whatnot.” Haymitch pauses a moment, as if deciding something. “He says he’d like to see you.”<br/>I’m on a frosting sailboat, tossed around by blue-green waves, the deck shifting beneath my feet. My palms press into the wall to steady myself. This wasn’t part of the plan. I wrote Peeta off in 2. Then I was to go to the Capitol, kill Snow, and get taken out myself. The gunshot was only a temporary setback. Never was I supposed to hear the words He says he’d like to see you. But now that I have, there’s no way to refuse.</td>

All those months of taking it for granted that Peeta thought I was wonderful are over. Finally, he can see me for who I really am. Violent. Distrustful. Manipulative. Deadly.<br/>And I hate him for it.</td>

It didn’t seem like much of a priority, jogging around a field with a gun with so many other things going on. And now I’m paying for my negligence.<br/>Back in the hospital, I find Johanna in the same circumstance and spitting mad. I tell her about what Coin said. “Maybe you can train, too.”<br/>“Fine. I’ll train. But I’m going to the stinking Capitol if I have to kill a crew and fly there myself,” says Johanna.<br/>“Probably best not to bring that up in training,” I say. “But it’s nice to know I’ll have a ride.”<br/>Johanna grins, and I feel a slight but significant shift in our relationship. I don’t know that we’re actually friends, but possibly the word allies would be accurate. That’s good. I’m going to need an ally.</td>

<td>It’s my ribs,” I explain to the trainer, a no-nonsense middle-aged woman we’re supposed to address as Soldier York. “They’re still bruised.”<br/><br/>“Well, I’ll tell you, Soldier Everdeen, those are going to take at least another month to heal up on their own,” she says.<br/>I shake my head. “I don’t have a month.”<br/>She looks me up and down. “The doctors haven’t offered you any treatment?”<br/>“Is there a treatment?” I ask. “They said they had to mend naturally.”<br/>“That’s what they say. But they could speed up the process if I recommend it. I warn you, though, it isn’t any fun,” she tells me.<br/>“Please. I’ve got to get to the Capitol,” I say.<br/>Soldier York doesn’t question this. She scribbles something on a pad and sends me directly back to the hospital. I hesitate. I don’t want to miss any more training. “I’ll be back for the afternoon session,” I promise. She just purses her lips.<br/>Twenty-four needle jabs to my rib cage later, I’m flattened out on my hospital bed, gritting my teeth to keep from begging them to bring back my morphling drip. It’s been by my bed so I can take a hit as needed. I haven’t used it lately, but I kept it for Johanna’s sake. Today they tested my blood to make sure it was clean of the painkiller, as the mixture of the two drugs—the morphling and whatever’s set my ribs on fire—has dangerous side effects. They made it clear I would have a difficult couple of days. But I told them to go ahead.<br/></td>

<td>It’s a bad night in our room. Sleep’s out of the question. I think I can actually smell the ring of flesh around my chest burning, and Johanna’s fighting off withdrawal symptoms. Early on, when I apologize about cutting off her morphling supply, she waves it off, saying it had to happen anyway. But by three in the morning, I’m the target of every colorful bit of profanity District 7 has to offer. At dawn, she drags me out of bed, determined to get to training.<br/>“I don’t think I can do it,” I confess.<br/>“You can do it. We both can. We’re victors, remember? We’re the ones who can survive anything they throw at us,” she snarls at me. She’s a sick greenish color, shaking like a leaf. I get dressed.<br/>We must be victors to make it through the morning. I think I’m going to lose Johanna when we realize it’s pouring outside. Her face turns ashen and she seems to have ceased breathing.<br/>“It’s just water. It won’t kill us,” I say. She clenches her jaw and stomps out into the mud. Rain drenches us as we work our bodies and then slog around the running course. I bail after a mile again, and I have to resist the temptation to take off my shirt so the cold water can sizzle off my ribs. I force down my field lunch of soggy fish and beet stew. Johanna gets halfway through her bowl before it comes back up. In the afternoon, we learn to assemble our guns. I manage it, but Johanna can’t hold her hands steady enough to fit the parts together. When York’s back is turned, I help her out. Even though the rain continues, the afternoon’s an improvement because we’re on the shooting range. At last, something I’m good at. It takes some adjusting from a bow to a gun, but by the end of the day, I’ve got the best score in my class.<br/>We’re just inside the hospital doors when Johanna declares, “This has to stop. Us living in the hospital. Everyone views us as patients.”<br/>It’s not a problem for me. I can move into our family compartment, but Johanna’s never been assigned one. When she tries to get discharged from the hospital, they won’t agree to let her live alone, even if she comes in for daily talks with the head doctor. I think they may have put two and two together about the morphling and this only adds to their view that she’s unstable. “She won’t be alone. I’m going to room with her,” I announce. There’s some dissent, but Haymitch takes our part, and by bedtime, we have a compartment across from Prim and my mother, who agrees to keep an eye on us.<br/>After I take a shower, and Johanna sort of wipes herself down with a damp cloth, she makes a cursory inspection of the place. When she opens the drawer that holds my few possessions, she shuts it quickly. “Sorry.”<br/>I think how there’s nothing in Johanna’s drawer but her government-issued clothes. That she doesn’t have one thing in the world to call her own. “It’s okay. You can look at my stuff if you want.”<br/></td>

She opens the silver parachute and pulls out the spile and slips it onto her pinkie. “Makes me thirsty just looking at it.” Then she finds the pearl Peeta gave me. “Is this—?”<br/><br/>“Yeah,” I say. “Made it through somehow.” I don’t want to talk about Peeta. One of the best things about training is, it keeps me from thinking of him.<br/>“Haymitch says he’s getting better,” she says.<br/>“Maybe. But he’s changed,” I say.<br/>“So have you. So have I. And Finnick and Haymitch and Beetee. Don’t get me started on Annie Cresta. The arena messed us all up pretty good, don’t you think? Or do you still feel like the girl who volunteered for your sister?” she asks me.<br/>“No,” I answer.<br/>“That’s the one thing I think my head doctor might be right about. There’s no going back. So we might as well get on with things.” She neatly returns my keepsakes to the drawer and climbs into the bed across from me just as the lights go out. “You’re not afraid I’ll kill you tonight?”<br/>“Like I couldn’t take you,” I answer. Then we laugh, since both our bodies are so wrecked, it will be a miracle if we can get up the next day. But we do. Each morning, we do.

His earlier incarnations—the decadent Capitol heartthrob I met before the Quell, the enigmatic ally in the arena, the broken young man who tried to help me hold it together—these have been replaced by someone who radiates life. Finnick’s real charms of self-effacing humor and an easygoing nature are on display for the first time. He never lets go of Annie’s hand. Not when they walk, not when they eat. I doubt he ever plans to. She’s lost in some daze of happiness. There are still moments when you can tell something slips in her brain and another world blinds her to us.

<td>I’m starving and the stew is so delicious—beef, potatoes, turnips, and onions in a thick gravy—that I have to force myself to slow down. All around the dining hall, you can feel the rejuvenating effect that a good meal can bring on. The way it can make people kinder, funnier, more optimistic, and remind them it’s not a mistake to go on living. It’s better than any medicine. So I try to make it last and join in the conversation. Sop up the gravy on my bread and nibble on it as I listen to Finnick telling some ridiculous story about a sea turtle swimming off with his hat. Laugh before I realize he’s standing there. Directly across the table, behind the empty seat next to Johanna. Watching me. I choke momentarily as the gravy bread sticks in my throat.<br/>“Peeta!” says Delly. “It’s so nice to see you out…and about.”<br/>Two large guards stand behind him. He holds his tray awkwardly, balanced on his fingertips since his wrists are shackled with a short chain between them.<br/>“What’s with the fancy bracelets?” asks Johanna.<br/>“I’m not quite trustworthy yet,” says Peeta. “I can’t even sit here without your permission.” He indicates the guards with his head.<br/>“Sure he can sit here. We’re old friends,” says Johanna, patting the space beside her. The guards nod and Peeta takes a seat. “Peeta and I had adjoining cells in the Capitol. We’re very familiar with each other’s screams.”<br/>Annie, who’s on Johanna’s other side, does that thing where she covers her ears and exits reality. Finnick shoots Johanna an angry look as his arm encircles Annie.<br/>“What? My head doctor says I’m not supposed to censor my thoughts. It’s part of my therapy,” replies Johanna.<br/><br/>The life has gone out of our little party. Finnick murmurs things to Annie until she slowly removes her hands.

<td>Annie,” says Delly brightly, “did you know it was Peeta who decorated your wedding cake? Back home, his family ran the bakery and he did all the icing.”<br/>Annie cautiously looks across Johanna. “Thank you, Peeta. It was beautiful.”<br/>“My pleasure, Annie,” says Peeta, and I hear that old note of gentleness in his voice that I thought was gone forever. Not that it’s directed at me. But still.<br/>“If we’re going to fit in that walk, we better go,” Finnick tells her. He arranges both of their trays so he can carry them in one hand while holding tightly to her with the other. “Good seeing you, Peeta.”<br/>“You be nice to her, Finnick. Or I might try and take her away from you.” It could be a joke, if the tone wasn’t so cold. Everything it conveys is wrong. The open distrust of Finnick, the implication that Peeta has his eye on Annie, that Annie could desert Finnick, that I do not even exist.<br/>“Oh, Peeta,” says Finnick lightly. “Don’t make me sorry I restarted your heart.” He leads Annie away after giving me a concerned glance.<br/>When they’re gone, Delly says in a reproachful voice, “He did save your life, Peeta. More than once.”<br/>“For her.” He gives me a brief nod. “For the rebellion. Not for me. I don’t owe him anything.”<br/><br/>I shouldn’t rise to the bait, but I do. “Maybe not. But Mags is dead and you’re still here. That should count for something.”<br/>“Yeah, a lot of things should count for something that don’t seem to, Katniss. I’ve got some memories I can’t make sense of, and I don’t think the Capitol touched them. A lot of nights on the train, for instance,” he says.<br/>Again the implications. That more happened on the train than did. That what did happen—those nights I only kept my sanity because his arms were around me—no longer matters. Everything a lie, everything a way of misusing him.<br/>Peeta makes a little gesture with his spoon, connecting Gale and me. “So, are you two officially a couple now, or are they still dragging out the star-crossed lover thing?”<br/>“Still dragging,” says Johanna.</td>

<td>It’s challenging, but not as hard as I was expecting. There’s a nagging feeling that if it’s too simple, I must be missing the point. I’m within a couple of buildings from my goal when things begin to heat up. A half dozen Peacekeepers come charging around the corner. They will outgun me, but I notice something. A drum of gasoline lying carelessly in the gutter. This is it. My test. To perceive that blowing up the drum will be the only way to achieve my mission. Just as I step out to do it, my squadron leader, who’s been fairly useless up to this point, quietly orders me to hit the ground. Every instinct I have screams for me to ignore the voice, to pull the trigger, to blow the Peacekeepers sky-high. And suddenly, I realize what the military will think my biggest weakness is. From my first moment in the Games, when I ran for that orange backpack, to the firefight in 8, to my impulsive race across the square in 2. I cannot take orders.<br/>I smack into the ground so hard and fast, I’ll be picking gravel out of my chin for a week. Someone else blows the gas tank. The Peacekeepers die. I make my rendezvous point. When I exit the Block on the far side, a soldier congratulates me, stamps my hand with squad number 451, and tells me to report to Command.

I bang into the room before the oddity of the situation dawns on me. I shouldn’t be in Command; I should be getting my hair buzzed.

<td>Plutarch stands over a wide, flat panel in the center of the table. He’s explaining something about the nature of what we will encounter in the Capitol. I’m thinking this is a terrible presentation—because even on tiptoe I can’t see what’s on the panel—until he hits a button. A holographic image of a block of the Capitol projects into the air.<br/>“This, for example, is the area surrounding one of the Peacekeepers’ barracks. Not unimportant, but not the most crucial of targets, and yet look.” Plutarch enters some sort of code on a keyboard, and lights begin to flash. They’re in an assortment of colors and blink at different speeds. “Each light is called a pod. It represents a different obstacle, the nature of which could be anything from a bomb to a band of mutts. Make no mistake, whatever it contains is designed to either trap or kill you. Some have been in place since the Dark Days, others developed over the years. To be honest, I created a fair number myself. This program, which one of our people absconded with when we left the Capitol, is our most recent information. They don’t know we have it. But even so, it’s likely that new pods have been activated in the last few months. This is what you will face.”<br/>I’m unaware that my feet are moving to the table until I’m inches from the holograph. My hand reaches in and cups a rapidly blinking green light.<br/>Someone joins me, his body tense. Finnick, of course. Because only a victor would see what I see so immediately. The arena. Laced with pods controlled by Gamemakers. Finnick’s fingers caress a steady red glow over a doorway. “Ladies and gentlemen…”<br/>His voice is quiet, but mine rings through the room. “Let the Seventy-sixth Hunger Games begin!”<br/>I laugh. Quickly. Before anyone has time to register what lies beneath the words I have just uttered. Before eyebrows are raised, objections are uttered, two and two are put together, and the solution is that I should be kept as far away from the Capitol as possible. Because an angry, independently thinking victor with a layer of psychological scar tissue too thick to penetrate is maybe the last person you want on your squad.<br/>“I don’t even know why you bothered to put Finnick and me through training, Plutarch,” I say.<br/>“Yeah, we’re already the two best-equipped soldiers you have,” Finnick adds cockily.<br/><br/>“Do not think that fact escapes me,” he says with an impatient wave. “Now back in line, Soldiers Odair and Everdeen. I have a presentation to finish.”<br/>We retreat to our places, ignoring the questioning looks thrown our way. I adopt an attitude of extreme concentration as Plutarch continues, nodding my head here and there, shifting my position to get a better view, all the while telling myself to hang on until I can get to the woods and scream. Or curse. Or cry. Or maybe all three at once.<br/>If this was a test, Finnick and I both pass it.</td>

When I tell him what I want to do, he writes me a pass so that I can go to the woods during Reflection, provided I stay within sight of the guards. I run to my compartment, thinking to use the parachute, but it’s so full of ugly memories. Instead, I go across the hall and take one of the white cotton bandages I brought from 12. Square. Sturdy. Just the thing.<br/>In the woods, I find a pine tree and strip handfuls of fragrant needles from the boughs. After making a neat pile in the middle of the bandage, I gather up the sides, give them a twist, and tie them tightly with a length of vine, making an apple-sized bundle.<br/>At the hospital room door, I watch Johanna for a moment, realize that most of her ferocity is in her abrasive attitude. Stripped of that, as she is now, there’s only a slight young woman, her wide-set eyes fighting to stay awake against the power of the drugs. Terrified of what sleep will bring. I cross to her and hold out the bundle.<br/>“What’s that?” she says hoarsely. Damp edges of her hair form little spikes over her forehead.<br/>“I made it for you. Something to put in your drawer.” I place it in her hands. “Smell it.”<br/>She lifts the bundle to her nose and takes a tentative sniff. “Smells like home.” Tears flood her eyes.<br/>“That’s what I was hoping. You being from Seven and all,” I say. “Remember when we met? You were a tree. Well, briefly.”<br/>Suddenly, she has my wrist in an iron grip. “You have to kill him, Katniss.”<br/>“Don’t worry.” I resist the temptation to wrench my arm free.<br/>“Swear it. On something you care about,” she hisses.<br/>“I swear it. On my life.” But she doesn’t let go of my arm.<br/>“On your family’s life,” she insists.<br/>“On my family’s life,” I repeat. I guess my concern for my own survival isn’t compelling enough. She lets go and I rub my wrist. “Why do you think I’m going, anyway, brainless?”<br/>That makes her smile a little. “I just needed to hear it.” She presses the bundle of pine needles to her nose and closes her eyes.<br/></td>

<td>It’s reassuring to see just how high the overall level of accuracy is in our group. Along with Finnick and Gale, the squad includes five soldiers from 13. Jackson, a middle-aged woman who’s Boggs’s second in command, looks kind of sluggish but can hit things the rest of us can’t even see without a scope. Farsighted, she says. There’s a pair of sisters in their twenties named Leeg—we call them Leeg 1 and Leeg 2 for clarity—who are so similar in uniform, I can’t tell them apart until I notice Leeg 1 has weird yellow flecks in her eyes. Two older guys, Mitchell and Homes, never say much but can shoot the dust off your boots at fifty yards. I see other squads that are also quite good, but I don’t fully understand our status until the morning Plutarch joins us.<br/>“Squad Four-Five-One, you have been selected for a special mission,” he begins. I bite the inside of my lip, hoping against hope that it’s to assassinate Snow. “We have numerous sharpshooters, but rather a dearth of camera crews. Therefore, we’ve handpicked the eight of you to be what we call our ‘Star Squad.’ You will be the on-screen faces of the invasion.”<br/>Disappointment, shock, then anger run through the group. “What you’re saying is, we won’t be in actual combat,” snaps Gale.<br/>“You will be in combat, but perhaps not always on the front line. If one can even isolate a front line in this type of war,” says Plutarch.<br/>“None of us wants that.” Finnick’s remark is followed by a general rumble of assent, but I stay silent. “We’re going to fight.”<br/>“You’re going to be as useful to the war effort as possible,” Plutarch says. “And it’s been decided that you are of most value on television. Just look at the effect Katniss had running around in that Mockingjay suit. Turned the whole rebellion around. Do you notice how she’s the only one not complaining? It’s because she understands the power of that screen.”<br/>Actually, Katniss isn’t complaining because she has no intention of staying with the “Star Squad,” but she recognizes the necessity of getting to the Capitol before carrying out any plan. Still, to be too compliant may arouse suspicion as well.<br/>“But it’s not all pretend, is it?” I ask. “That’d be a waste of talent.”<br/>“Don’t worry,” Plutarch tells me. “You’ll have plenty of real targets to hit. But don’t get blown up. </td>

<td>Mitchell asks about hoverplane bombings—we do feel very naked pitched out in the open—but Boggs says it’s not an issue. Most of the Capitol’s air fleet was destroyed in 2 or during the invasion. If it has any craft left, it’s holding on to them. Probably so Snow and his inner circle can make a last-minute escape to some presidential bunker somewhere if needed. Our own hoverplanes were grounded after the Capitol’s antiaircraft missiles decimated the first few waves. This war will be battled out on the streets with, hopefully, only superficial damage to the infrastructure and a minimum of human casualties. The rebels want the Capitol, just as the Capitol wanted 13.</td>

<td>After three days, much of Squad 451 risks deserting out of boredom. Cressida and her team take shots of us firing. They tell us we’re part of the disinformation team. If the rebels only shoot Plutarch’s pods, it will take the Capitol about two minutes to realize we have the holograph. So there’s a lot of time spent shattering things that don’t matter, to throw them off the scent. Mostly we just add to the piles of rainbow glass that’s been blown off the exteriors of the candy-colored buildings. I suspect they are intercutting this footage with the destruction of significant Capitol targets. Once in a while it seems a real sharpshooter’s services are needed. Eight hands go up, but Gale, Finnick, and I are never chosen.<br/>“It’s your own fault for being so camera-ready,” I tell Gale. If looks could kill.<br/>I don’t think they quite know what to do with the three of us, particularly me. I have my Mockingjay outfit with me, but I’ve only been taped in my uniform. Sometimes I use a gun, sometimes they ask me to shoot with my bow and arrows. It’s as if they don’t want to entirely lose the Mockingjay, but they want to downgrade my role to foot soldier. Since I don’t care, it’s amusing rather than upsetting to imagine the arguments going on back in 13.</td>

<td>While I outwardly express discontent about our lack of any real participation, I’m busy with my own agenda. Each of us has a paper map of the Capitol. The city forms an almost perfect square. Lines divide the map into smaller squares, with letters along the top and numbers down the side to form a grid. I consume this, noting every intersection and side street, but it’s remedial stuff. The commanders here are working off Plutarch’s holograph. Each has a handheld contraption called a Holo that produces images like I saw in Command. They can zoom into any area of the grid and see what pods await them. The Holo’s an independent unit, a glorified map really, since it can neither send nor receive signals. But it’s far superior to my paper version.<br/>A Holo is activated by a specific commander’s voice giving his or her name. Once it’s working, it responds to the other voices in the squadron so if, say, Boggs were killed or severely disabled, someone could take over. If anyone in the squad repeats “nightlock” three times in a row, the Holo will explode, blowing everything in a five-yard radius sky-high. This is for security reasons in the event of capture. It’s understood that we would all do this without hesitation.<br/>So what I need to do is steal Boggs’s activated Holo and clear out before he notices. I think it would be easier to steal his teeth.</td>

No guards. Strolling out of the train station with his gun swinging from the strap over his shoulder. There’s shock, confusion, resistance, but 451 is stamped on the back of Peeta’s hand in fresh ink.

<td>Seeing the cause of my current dilemma calmly pitching his tent back at our site makes me furious. “What time is my watch?” I ask Jackson.<br/>She squints at me in doubt, or maybe she’s just trying to get my face in focus. “I didn’t put you in the rotation.”<br/>“Why not?” I ask.<br/>“I’m not sure you could really shoot Peeta, if it came to it,” she says.<br/>I speak up so the whole squad can hear me clearly. “I wouldn’t be shooting Peeta. He’s gone. Johanna’s right. It’d be just like shooting another of the Capitol’s mutts.” It feels good to say something horrible about him, out loud, in public, after all the humiliation I’ve felt since his return.<br/>“Well, that sort of comment isn’t recommending you either,” says Jackson.<br/>“Put her in the rotation,” I hear Boggs say behind me.<br/>Jackson shakes her head and makes a note. “Midnight to four. You’re on with me.”<br/>The dinner whistle sounds, and Gale and I line up at the canteen. “Do you want me to kill him?” he asks bluntly.<br/>“That’ll get us both sent back for sure,” I say. But even though I’m furious, the brutality of the offer rattles me. “I can deal with him.”<br/>“You mean until you take off? You and your paper map and possibly a Holo if you can get your hands on it?” So Gale has not missed my preparations. I hope they haven’t been so obvious to the others. None of them know my mind like he does, though. “You’re not planning on leaving me behind, are you?” he asks.<br/>Up until this point, I was. But having my hunting partner to watch my back doesn’t sound like a bad idea. “As your fellow soldier, I have to strongly recommend you stay with your squad.

<td>Squad 451 and the television crew collect dinner from the canteen and gather in a tense circle to eat. At first I think that Peeta is the cause of the unease, but by the end of the meal, I realize more than a few unfriendly looks have been directed my way. This is a quick turnaround, since I’m pretty sure when Peeta appeared the whole team was concerned about how dangerous he might be, especially to me. But it’s not until I get a phone call through to Haymitch that I understand.<br/>“What are you trying to do? Provoke him into an attack?” he asks me.<br/>“Of course not. I just want him to leave me alone,” I say.<br/>“Well, he can’t. Not after what the Capitol put him through,” says Haymitch. “Look, Coin may have sent him there hoping he’d kill you, but Peeta doesn’t know that. He doesn’t understand what’s happened to him. So you can’t blame him—”<br/>“I don’t!” I say.<br/>“You do! You’re punishing him over and over for things that are out of his control. Now, I’m not saying you shouldn’t have a fully loaded weapon next to you round the clock. But I think it’s time you flipped this little scenario around in your head. If you’d been taken by the Capitol, and hijacked, and then tried to kill Peeta, is this the way he would be treating you?” demands Haymitch.<br/>I fall silent. It isn’t. It isn’t how he would be treating me at all. He would be trying to get me back at any cost. Not shutting me out, abandoning me, greeting me with hostility at every turn.<br/>“You and me, we made a deal to try and save him. Remember?” Haymitch says.

<td>The autumn day turns from brisk to cold. Most of the squad hunker down in their sleeping bags. Some sleep under the open sky, close to the heater in the center of our camp, while others retreat to their tents. Leeg 1 has finally broken down over her sister’s death, and her muffled sobs reach us through the canvas. I huddle in my tent, thinking over Haymitch’s words. Realizing with shame that my fixation with assassinating Snow has allowed me to ignore a much more difficult problem. Trying to rescue Peeta from the shadowy world the hijacking has stranded him in. I don’t know how to find him, let alone lead him out. I can’t even conceive of a plan. It makes the task of crossing a loaded arena, locating Snow, and putting a bullet through his head look like child’s play.<br/>At midnight, I crawl out of my tent and position myself on a camp stool near the heater to take my watch with Jackson. Boggs told Peeta to sleep out in full view where the rest of us could keep an eye on him. He isn’t sleeping, though. Instead, he sits with his bag pulled up to his chest, clumsily trying to make knots in a short length of rope. I know it well. It’s the one Finnick lent me that night in the bunker. Seeing it in his hands, it’s like Finnick’s echoing what Haymitch just said, that I’ve cast off Peeta. Now might be a good time to begin to remedy that. If I could think of something to say. But I can’t. So I don’t. I just let the sounds of soldiers’ breathing fill the night.</td>

<td>After about an hour, Peeta speaks up. “These last couple of years must have been exhausting for you. Trying to decide whether to kill me or not. Back and forth. Back and forth.”<br/>That seems grossly unfair, and my first impulse is to say something cutting. But I revisit my conversation with Haymitch and try to take the first tentative step in Peeta’s direction. “I never wanted to kill you. Except when I thought you were helping the Careers kill me. After that, I always thought of you as…an ally.” That’s a good safe word. Empty of any emotional obligation, but nonthreatening.<br/>“Ally.” Peeta says the word slowly, tasting it. “Friend. Lover. Victor. Enemy. Fiancée. Target. Mutt. Neighbor. Hunter. Tribute. Ally. I’ll add it to the list of words I use to try to figure you out.” He weaves the rope in and out of his fingers. “The problem is, I can’t tell what’s real anymore, and what’s made up.”<br/>The cessation of rhythmic breathing suggests that either people have woken or have never really been asleep at all. I suspect the latter.<br/>Finnick’s voice rises from a bundle in the shadows. “Then you should ask, Peeta. That’s what Annie does.”<br/><br/>“Ask who?” Peeta says. “Who can I trust?”<br/>“Well, us for starters. We’re your squad,” says Jackson.<br/>“You’re my guards,” he points out.<br/>“That, too,” she says. “But you saved a lot of lives in Thirteen. It’s not the kind of thing we forget.”<br/>In the quiet that follows, I try to imagine not being able to tell illusion from reality. Not knowing if Prim or my mother loved me. If Snow was my enemy. If the person across the heater saved or sacrificed me. With very little effort, my life rapidly morphs into a nightmare. I suddenly want to tell Peeta everything about who he is, and who I am, and how we ended up here. But I don’t know how to start. Worthless. I’m worthless.<br/>At a few minutes before four, Peeta turns to me again. “Your favorite color…it’s green?”<br/>“That’s right.” Then I think of something to add. “And yours is orange.”<br/>“Orange?” He seems unconvinced.<br/>“Not bright orange. But soft. Like the sunset,” I say. “At least, that’s what you told me once.”<br/>“Oh.” He closes his eyes briefly, maybe trying to conjure up that sunset, then nods his head. “Thank you.”<br/>But more words tumble out. “You’re a painter. You’re a baker. You like to sleep with the windows open. You never take sugar in your tea. And you always double-knot your shoelaces.”<br/>Then I dive into my tent before I do something stupid like cry.</td>

It’s not a steady conversation. Peeta spends a long time considering even small pieces of information, like where people bought their soap back home. Gale fills him in on a lot of stuff about 12; Finnick is the expert on both of Peeta’s Games, as he was a mentor in the first and a tribute in the second. But since Peeta’s greatest confusion centers around me—and not everything can be explained simply—our exchanges are painful and loaded, even though we touch on only the most superficial of details. The color of my dress in 7. My preference for cheese buns. The name of our math teacher when we were little. Reconstructing his memory of me is excruciating.

I can tell by the way you swallow. There were two Avoxes with me in prison. Darius and Lavinia, but the guards mostly called them the redheads. They’d been our servants in the Training Center, so they arrested them, too. I watched them being tortured to death. She was lucky. They used too much voltage and her heart stopped right off. It took days to finish him off. Beating, cutting off parts. They kept asking him questions, but he couldn’t speak, he just made these horrible animal sounds. They didn’t want information, you know? They wanted me to see it.”<br/>Peeta looks around at our stunned faces, as if waiting for a reply. When none is forthcoming, he asks, “Real or not real?” The lack of response upsets him more. “Real or not real?!” he demands.<br/>“Real,” says Boggs. “At least, to the best of my knowledge…real.”<br/>Peeta sags. “I thought so. There was nothing…shiny about it.” He wanders away from the group, muttering something about fingers and toes.<br/>I move to Gale, press my forehead into the body armor where his chest should be, feel his arm tighten around me. We finally know the name of the girl who we watched the Capitol abduct from the woods of 12, the fate of the Peacekeeper friend who tried to keep Gale alive. This is no time to call up happy moments of remembrance. They lost their lives because of me. I add them to my personal list of kills that began in the arena and now includes thousands.

I turn to Boggs, very badly needing him alive. Suddenly sure that he, and maybe he alone, is completely on my side. I think of his last orders….<br/>“Don’t trust them. Don’t go back. Kill Peeta. Do what you came to do.”<br/><br/>What did he mean? Don’t trust who? The rebels? Coin? The people looking at me right now? I won’t go back, but he must know I can’t just fire a bullet through Peeta’s head. Can I? Should I? Did Boggs guess that what I really came to do is desert and kill Snow on my own?<br/>I can’t work all of this out now, so I just decide to carry out the first two orders: to not trust anyone and to move deeper into the Capitol. But how can I justify this? Make them let me keep the Holo?<br/>“Because I’m on a special mission for President Coin. I think Boggs was the only one who knew about it.”<br/>This in no way convinces Jackson. “To do what?”<br/>Why not tell them the truth? It’s as plausible as anything I’ll come up with.

Half the squad at Jackson, half at me. Someone’s about to die, when Cressida speaks up. “It’s true. That’s why we’re here. Plutarch wants it televised. He thinks if we can film the Mockingjay assassinating Snow, it will end the war.”<br/>This gives even Jackson pause. Then she gestures with her gun toward the closet. “And why is he here?”<br/><br/>There she has me. I can think of no sane reason that Coin would send an unstable boy, programmed to kill me, along on such a key assignment. It really weakens my story.

Plutarch thinks Peeta may be of some use as a guide in a location we have little knowledge of.”<br/>I want to ask Cressida why she’s lying for me, why she’s fighting for us to go on with my self-appointed mission.

We’re going out the way we came in.”<br/>Instant objections. I raise my voice over them. “If the wave was that powerful, then it may have triggered and absorbed other pods in our path.”<br/>People stop to consider this. Pollux makes a few quick signs to his brother. “It may have disabled the cameras as well,” Castor translates. “Coated the lenses.”<br/>Gale props one of his boots on the counter and examines the splatter of black on the toe. Scrapes it with a kitchen knife from a block on the counter. “It’s not corrosive. I think it was meant to either suffocate or poison us.”<br/>“Probably our best shot,” says Leeg 1.<br/>Masks go on.

<td>The pink and orange block seems to have been dipped in glossy black paint and set out to dry. Paving stones, buildings, even the rooftops are coated in the gel. A large teardrop hangs above the street. Two shapes project from it. A gun barrel and a human hand. Mitchell. I wait on the sidewalk, staring up at him until the entire group has joined me.<br/>“If anyone needs to go back, for whatever reason, now is the time,” I say. “No questions asked, no hard feelings.” No one seems inclined to retreat. So I start moving into the Capitol, knowing we don’t have much time. The gel’s deeper here, four to six inches, and makes a sucking sound each time you pick up your foot, but it still covers our tracks.<br/></td>

<td>Although no one has made a move toward it, the television flares to life, emitting a high-pitched beeping sound, bringing half our party to its feet.<br/>“It’s all right!” calls Cressida. “It’s just an emergency broadcast. Every Capitol television is automatically activated for it.”<br/>There we are on-screen, just after the bomb took out Boggs. A voice-over tells the audience what they are viewing as we try to regroup, react to the black gel shooting from the street, lose control of the situation. We watch the chaos that follows until the wave blots out the cameras. The last thing we see is Gale, alone on the street, trying to shoot through the cables that hold Mitchell aloft.<br/>The reporter identifies Gale, Finnick, Boggs, Peeta, Cressida, and me by name.<br/>“There’s no aerial footage. Boggs must have been right about their hovercraft capacity,” says Castor. I didn’t notice this, but I guess it’s the kind of thing a cameraman picks up on.<br/>Coverage continues from the courtyard behind the apartment where we took shelter. Peacekeepers line the roof across from our former hideout. Shells are launched into the row of apartments, setting off the chain of explosions we heard, and the building collapses into rubble and dust.<br/>Now we cut to a live feed. A reporter stands on the roof with the Peacekeepers. Behind her, the apartment block burns. Firefighters try to control the blaze with water hoses. We are pronounced dead.<br/>“Finally, a bit of luck,” says Homes.<br/>I guess he’s right. Certainly it’s better than having the Capitol in pursuit of us. But I just keep imagining how this will be playing back in 13. Where my mother and Prim, Hazelle and the kids, Annie, Haymitch, and a whole lot of people from 13 think that they have just seen us die.<br/>“My father. He just lost my sister and now…” says Leeg 1.<br/>We watch as they play the footage over and over. Revel in their victory, especially over me. Break away to do a montage of the Mockingjay’s rise to rebel power—I think they’ve had this part prepared for a while, because it seems pretty polished—and then go live so a couple of reporters can discuss my well-deserved violent end. Later, they promise, Snow will make an official statement. The screen fades back to a glow.<br/>The rebels made no attempt to break in during the broadcast, which leads me to believe they think it’s true. If that’s so, we really are on our own.<br/>“So, now that we’re dead, what’s our next move?” asks Gale.<br/>“Isn’t it obvious?” No one even knew Peeta had regained consciousness. I don’t know how long he’s been watching, but by the look of misery on his face, long enough to see what happened on the street. How he went mad, tried to bash my head in, and hurled Mitchell into the pod. He painfully pushes himself up to a sitting position and directs his words to Gale.<br/>“Our next move…is to kill me.”</td>

<td>That makes two requests for Peeta’s death in less than an hour.<br/>“Don’t be ridiculous,” says Jackson.<br/>“I just murdered a member of our squad!” shouts Peeta.<br/>“You pushed him off you. You couldn’t have known he would trigger the net at that exact spot,” says Finnick, trying to calm him.<br/>“Who cares? He’s dead, isn’t he?” Tears begin to run down Peeta’s face. “I didn’t know. I’ve never seen myself like that before. Katniss is right. I’m the monster. I’m the mutt. I’m the one Snow has turned into a weapon!”<br/>“It’s not your fault, Peeta,” says Finnick.<br/>“You can’t take me with you. It’s only a matter of time before I kill someone else.” Peeta looks around at our conflicted faces. “Maybe you think it’s kinder to just dump me somewhere. Let me take my chances. But that’s the same thing as handing me over to the Capitol. Do you think you’d be doing me a favor by sending me back to Snow?”<br/>Peeta. Back in Snow’s hands. Tortured and tormented until no bits of his former self will ever emerge again.<br/>For some reason, the last stanza to “The Hanging Tree” starts running through my head. The one where the man wants his lover dead rather than have her face the evil that awaits her in the world.<br/><br/>Are you, are you<br/>Coming to the tree<br/>Wear a necklace of rope, side by side with me.<br/>Strange things did happen here<br/>No stranger would it be<br/>If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree.<br/><br/>“I’ll kill you before that happens,” says Gale. “I promise.”<br/>Peeta hesitates, as if considering the reliability of this offer, and then shakes his head. “It’s no good. What if you’re not there to do it? I want one of those poison pills like the rest of you have.”<br/>Nightlock. There’s one pill back at camp, in its special slot on the sleeve of my Mockingjay suit. But there’s another in the breast pocket of my uniform. Interesting that they didn’t issue one to Peeta. Perhaps Coin thought he might take it before he had the opportunity to kill me. It’s unclear if Peeta means he’d finish himself off now, to spare us having to murder him, or only if the Capitol took him prisoner again. In the state he’s in, I expect it would be sooner rather than later. It would certainly make things easier on the rest of us. Not to have to shoot him. It would certainly simplify the problem of dealing with his homicidal episodes.<br/>I don’t know if it’s the pods, or the fear, or watching Boggs die, but I feel the arena all around me. It’s as if I’ve never left, really. Once again I’m battling not only for my own survival but for Peeta’s as well. How satisfying, how entertaining it would be for Snow to have me kill him. To have Peeta’s death on my conscience for whatever is left of my life.<br/>“It’s not about you,” I say. “We’re on a mission. And you’re necessary to it.” I look to the rest of the group. “Think we might find some food here?”<br/>Besides the medical kit and cameras, we have nothing but our uniforms and our weapons.<br/>Half of us stay to guard Peeta or keep an eye out for Snow’s broadcast, while the others hunt for something to eat. Messalla proves most valuable because he lived in a near replica of this apartment and knows where people would be most likely to stash food. Like how there’s a storage space concealed by a mirrored panel in the bedroom, or how easy it is to pop out the ventilation screen in the hallway. So even though the kitchen cupboards are bare, we find over thirty canned goods and several boxes of cookies.<br/>The hoarding disgusts the soldiers raised in 13. “Isn’t this illegal?” says Leeg 1.<br/>“On the contrary, in the Capitol you’d be considered stupid not to do it,” says Messalla. “Even before the Quarter Quell, people were starting to stock up on scarce supplies.”<br/>“While others went without,” says Leeg 1.<br/>“Right,” says Messalla. “That’s how it works here.”<br/>“Fortunately, or we wouldn’t have dinner,” says Gale. “Everybody grab a can.”<br/>Some of our company seem reluctant to do this, but it’s as good a method as any. I’m really not in the mood to divvy up everything into eleven equal parts, factoring in age, body weight, and physical output. I poke around in the pile, about to settle on some cod chowder, when Peeta holds out a can to me. “Here.”<br/>I take it, not knowing what to expect. The label reads Lamb Stew.<br/>I press my lips together at the memories of rain dripping through stones, my inept attempts at flirting, and the aroma of my favorite Capitol dish in the chilly air. So some part of it must still be in his head, too. How happy, how hungry, how close we were when that picnic basket arrived outside our cave. “Thanks.” I pop open the top. “It even has dried plums.” I bend the lid and use it as a makeshift spoon, scooping a bit into my mouth. Now this place tastes like the arena, too</td>

How can we possibly move forward into this bouquet of blinking lights without detection? We can’t. And if we can’t, we are trapped like birds in a net. I decide it’s best not to adopt some sort of superior attitude when I’m with these people. Especially when my eyes keep drifting to that green sofa. So I say, “Any ideas?”<br/>“Why don’t we start by ruling out possibilities,” says Finnick. “The street is not a possibility.”<br/>“The rooftops are just as bad as the street,” says Leeg 1.<br/>“We still might have a chance to withdraw, go back the way we came,” says Homes. “But that would mean a failed mission.”<br/><br/>A pang of guilt hits me since I’ve fabricated said mission. “It was never intended for all of us to go forward.

Send the empty cans down a trash chute, pocket the full ones for later, flip sofa cushions smeared with blood, wipe traces of gel from the tiles. There’s no fixing the latch on the front door, but we lock a second bolt, which will at least keep the door from swinging open on contact.<br/>Finally, there’s only Peeta to contend with. He plants himself on the blue sofa, refusing to budge. “I’m not going. I’ll either disclose your position or hurt someone else.”<br/>“Snow’s people will find you,” says Finnick.<br/>“Then leave me a pill. I’ll only take it if I have to,” says Peeta.<br/>“That’s not an option. Come along,” says Jackson.<br/>“Or you’ll what? Shoot me?” asks Peeta.<br/>“We’ll knock you out and drag you with us,” says Homes. “Which will both slow us down and endanger us.”<br/>“Stop being noble! I don’t care if I die!” He turns to me, pleading now. “Katniss, please. Don’t you see, I want to be out of this?”<br/>The trouble is, I do see. Why can’t I just let him go? Slip him a pill, pull the trigger? Is it because I care too much about Peeta or too much about letting Snow win? Have I turned him into a piece in my private Games? That’s despicable, but I’m not sure it’s beneath me. If it’s true, it would be kindest to kill Peeta here and now. But for better or worse, I am not motivated by kindness. “We’re wasting time. Are you coming voluntarily or do we knock you out?”<br/>Peeta buries his face in his hands for a few moments, then rises to join us.<br/>“Should we free his hands?” asks Leeg 1.<br/>“No!” Peeta growls at her, drawing his cuffs in close to his body.<br/>“No,” I echo. “But I want the key.” Jackson passes it over without a word.

<td>Peeta called it right. Pollux turns out to be worth ten Holos. There is a simple network of wide tunnels that directly corresponds to the main street plan above, underlying the major avenues and cross streets. It’s called the Transfer, since small trucks use it to deliver goods around the city. During the day, its many pods are deactivated, but at night it’s a minefield. However, hundreds of additional passages, utility shafts, train tracks, and drainage tubes form a multilevel maze. Pollux knows details that would lead to disaster for a newcomer, like which offshoots might require gas masks or have live wires or rats the size of beavers. He alerts us to the gush of water that sweeps through the sewers periodically, anticipates the time the Avoxes will be changing shifts, leads us into damp, obscure pipes to dodge the nearly silent passage of cargo trains. Most important, he has knowledge of the cameras. There aren’t many down in this gloomy, misty place, except in the Transfer. But we keep well out of their way.<br/></td>

Inside, Messalla is as still as a statue, poised up on the ball of one foot, head tilted back, held captive by the beam. I can’t tell if he’s yelling, although his mouth is stretched wide.

<td>I hear scuffling out on the street, move to the windows, and peek out a crack in the shutters. In the early morning light, I see a bizarre spectacle. Refugees from the now occupied blocks are streaming toward the Capitol’s center. The most panicked are wearing nothing but nightgowns and slippers, while the more prepared are heavily bundled in layers of clothes. They carry everything from lapdogs to jewelry boxes to potted plants. One man in a fluffy robe holds only an overripe banana. Confused, sleepy children stumble along after their parents, most either too stunned or too baffled to cry. Bits of them flash by my line of vision. A pair of wide brown eyes. An arm clutching a favorite doll. A pair of bare feet, bluish in the cold, catching on the uneven paving stones of the alley. Seeing them reminds me of the children of 12 who died fleeing the firebombs. I leave the window.</td>

<td>As I chew, I try to pay attention to Tigris telling us how she acquired it, but the main thing I absorb is that fur underwear is a valuable trading item at the moment. Especially for people who left their homes underdressed. Many are still out on the street, trying to find shelter for the night. Those who live in the choice apartments of the inner city have not flung open their doors to house the displaced. On the contrary, most of them bolted their locks, drew their shutters, and pretended to be out. Now the City Circle’s packed with refugees, and the Peacekeepers are going door to door, breaking into places if they have to, to assign houseguests</td>

<td> the television, we watch a terse Head Peacekeeper lay out specific rules regarding how many people per square foot each resident will be expected to take in. He reminds the citizens of the Capitol that temperatures will drop well below freezing tonight and warns them that their president expects them to be not only willing but enthusiastic hosts in this time of crisis. Then they show some very staged-looking shots of concerned citizens welcoming grateful refugees into their homes. The Head Peacekeeper says the president himself has ordered part of his mansion readied to receive citizens tomorrow. He adds that shopkeepers should also be prepared to lend their floor space if requested.<br/>“Tigris, that could be you,” says Peeta. I realize he’s right. That even this narrow hallway of a shop could be appropriated as the numbers swell. Then we’ll be truly trapped in the cellar, in constant danger of discovery. How many days do we have? One? Maybe two?<br/>The Head Peacekeeper comes back with more instructions for the population. It seems that this evening there was an unfortunate incident where a crowd beat to death a young man who resembled Peeta. Henceforth, all rebel sightings are to be reported immediately to authorities, who will deal with the identification and arrest of the suspect. They show a photo of the victim. Apart from some obviously bleached curls, he looks about as much like Peeta as I do.<br/>“People have gone wild,” Cressida murmurs.<br/></td>

<td>We spend a fitful night, woken by one another’s nightmares, minds buzzing with the next day’s plans. I’m relieved when five o’clock rolls around and we can begin whatever this day holds for us. We eat a mishmash of our remaining food—canned peaches, crackers, and snails—leaving one can of salmon for Tigris as meager thanks for all she’s done. The gesture seems to touch her in some way. Her face contorts in an odd expression and she flies into action. She spends the next hour remaking the five of us. She redresses us so regular clothes hide our uniforms before we even don our coats and cloaks. Covers our military boots with some sort of furry slippers. Secures our wigs with pins. Cleans off the garish remains of the paint we so hastily applied to our faces and makes us up again. Drapes our outerwear to conceal our weapons. Then gives us handbags and bundles of knickknacks to carry. In the end, we look exactly like the refugees fleeing the rebels.<br/>“Never underestimate the power of a brilliant stylist,” says Peeta. It’s hard to tell, but I think Tigris might actually blush under her stripes.<br/>There are no helpful updates on the television, but the alley</td>

They’ll assign us a new place to live,” puffs the man.<br/>We turn off the alley and spill out onto one of the main avenues. “Stay to the right!” a voice orders, and I see the Peacekeepers interspersed throughout the crowd, directing the flow of human traffic. Scared faces peer out of the plate-glass windows of the shops, which are already becoming overrun with refugees. At this rate, Tigris may have new houseguests by lunch.

<td>It’s brighter now, even with the snow picking up. I catch sight of Cressida and Pollux about thirty yards ahead of us, plodding along with the crowd. I crane my head around to see if I can locate Peeta. I can’t, but I’ve caught the eye of an inquisitive-looking little girl in a lemon yellow coat. I nudge Gale and slow my pace ever so slightly, to allow a wall of people to form between us.<br/>“We might need to split up,” I say under my breath. “There’s a girl—”<br/>Gunfire rips through the crowd, and several people near me slump to the ground. Screams pierce the air as a second round mows down another group behind us. Gale and I drop to the street, scuttle the ten yards to the shops, and take cover behind a display of spike-heeled boots outside a shoe seller’s.<br/>A row of feathery footwear blocks Gale’s view. “Who is it? Can you see?” he asks me. What I can see, between alternating pairs of lavender and mint green leather boots, is a street full of bodies. The little girl who was watching me kneels beside a motionless woman, screeching and trying to rouse her. Another wave of bullets slices across the chest of her yellow coat, staining it with red, knocking the girl onto her back. For a moment, looking at her tiny crumpled form, I lose my ability to form words. Gale prods me with his elbow. “Katniss?”<br/>“They’re shooting from the roof above us,” I tell Gale. I watch a few more rounds, see the white uniforms dropping into the snowy streets. “Trying to take out the Peacekeepers, but they’re not exactly crack shots. It must be the rebels.” I don’t feel a rush of joy, although theoretically my allies have broken through. I am transfixed by that lemon yellow coat.</td>

I shake my head to indicate my confusion. At any minute, they’ll realize who they’ve captured. The Peacekeepers are hauling him inside now. “Go!” I hear him yell.<br/>I turn and run away from the pod. All alone now. Gale a prisoner. Cressida and Pollux could be dead ten times over. And Peeta? I haven’t laid eyes on him since we left Tigris’s. I hold on to the idea that he may have gone back. Felt an attack coming and retreated to the cellar while he still had control. Realized there was no need for a diversion when the Capitol has provided so many. No need to be bait and have to take the nightlock—the nightlock! Gale doesn’t have any. And as for all that talk of detonating his arrows by hand, he’ll never get the chance. The first thing the Peacekeepers will do is to strip him of his weapons.<br/>I fall into a doorway, tears stinging my eyes. Shoot me. That’s what he was mouthing. I was supposed to shoot him! That was my job. That was our unspoken promise, all of us, to one another. And I didn’t do it and now the Capitol will kill him or torture him or hijack him or—the cracks begin opening inside me, threatening to break me into pieces. I have only one hope. That the Capitol falls, lays down its arms, and gives up its prisoners before they hurt Gale. But I can’t see that happening while Snow’s alive</td>

<td>I begin to weave my way across to the mansion, tripping over abandoned treasures and snow-frosted limbs. About halfway there, I become aware of the concrete barricade. It’s about four feet high and extends in a large rectangle in front of the mansion. You would think it would be empty, but it’s packed with refugees. Maybe this is the group that’s been chosen to be sheltered at the mansion? But as I draw closer, I notice something else. Everyone inside the barricade is a child. Toddlers to teenagers. Scared and frostbitten. Huddled in groups or rocking numbly on the ground. They aren’t being led into the mansion. They’re penned in, guarded on all sides by Peacekeepers. I know immediately it’s not for their protection. If the Capitol wanted to safeguard them, they’d be down in a bunker somewhere. This is for Snow’s protection. The children form his human shield.</td>

<td>A hovercraft marked with the Capitol’s seal materializes directly over the barricaded children. Scores of silver parachutes rain down on them. Even in this chaos, the children know what silver parachutes contain. Food. Medicine. Gifts. They eagerly scoop them up, frozen fingers struggling with the strings. The hovercraft vanishes, five seconds pass, and then about twenty parachutes simultaneously explode.<br/>A wail rises from the crowd. The snow’s red and littered with undersized body parts. Many of the children die immediately, but others lie in agony on the ground. Some stagger around mutely, staring at the remaining silver parachutes in their hands, as if they still might have something precious inside. I can tell the Peacekeepers didn’t know this was coming by the way they are yanking away the barricades, making a path to the children. Another flock of white uniforms sweeps into the opening. But these aren’t Peacekeepers. They’re medics. Rebel medics. I’d know the uniforms anywhere. They swarm in among the children, wielding medical kits.<br/><br/>First I get a glimpse of the blond braid down her back. Then, as she yanks off her coat to cover a wailing child, I notice the duck tail formed by her untucked shirt. I have the same reaction I did the day Effie Trinket called her name at the reaping. At least, I must go limp, because I find myself at the base of the flagpole, unable to account for the last few seconds. Then I am pushing through the crowd, just as I did before. Trying to shout her name above the roar. I’m almost there, almost to the barricade, when I think she hears me. Because for just a moment, she catches sight of me, her lips form my name.<br/>And that’s when the rest of the parachutes go off.</td>

<td>One day I awake to expectations and know I will not be allowed to live in my dreamland. I must take food by mouth. Move my own muscles. Make my way to the bathroom. A brief appearance by President Coin clinches it.<br/>“Don’t worry,” she says. “I’ve saved him for you.”<br/>The doctors’ puzzlement grows over why I’m unable to speak. Many tests are done, and while there’s damage to my vocal cords, it doesn’t account for it.

On President Snow: He’s being held prisoner, awaiting trial and most certain execution. On my assassination team: Cressida and Pollux have been sent out into the districts to cover the wreckage of the war. Gale, who took two bullets in an escape attempt, is mopping up Peacekeepers in 2. Peeta’s still in the burn unit. He made it to the City Circle after all. On my family: My mother buries her grief in her work.<br/>Having no work, grief buries me.

<td>Late one afternoon, after a long period in a cushioned window seat behind a painted screen, I emerge and turn left instead of right. I find myself in a strange part of the mansion, and immediately lose my bearings. Unlike the area where I’m quartered, there seems to be no one around to ask. I like it, though. Wish I’d found it sooner. It’s so quiet, with the thick carpets and heavy tapestries soaking up the sound. Softly lit. Muted colors. Peaceful. Until I smell the roses. I dive behind some curtains, shaking too hard to run, while I await the mutts. Finally, I realize there are no mutts coming. So, what do I smell? Real roses? Could it be that I am near the garden where the evil things grow?<br/>As I creep down the hall, the odor becomes overpowering. Perhaps not as strong as the actual mutts, but purer, because it’s not competing with sewage and explosives. I turn a corner and find myself staring at two surprised guards. Not Peacekeepers, of course. There are no more Peacekeepers. But not the trim, gray-uniformed soldiers from 13 either. These two, a man and a woman, wear the tattered, thrown-together clothes of actual rebels. Still bandaged and gaunt, they are now keeping watch over the doorway to the roses. When I move to enter, their guns form an X in front of me.<br/>“You can’t go in, miss,” says the man.<br/>“Soldier,” the woman corrects him. “You can’t go in, Soldier Everdeen. President’s orders.”<br/>I just stand there patiently waiting for them to lower their guns, for them to understand, without my telling them, that behind those doors is something I need. Just a rose. A single bloom. To place in Snow’s lapel before I shoot him. My presence seems to worry the guards. They’re discussing calling Haymitch, when a woman speaks up behind me. “Let her go in.”<br/>I know the voice but can’t immediately place it. Not Seam, not 13, definitely not Capitol. I turn my head and find myself face-to-face with Paylor, the commander from 8. She looks even more beat up than she did at the hospital, but who doesn’t?<br/>“On my authority,” says Paylor. “She has a right to anything behind that door.” These are her soldiers, not Coin’s.

<td>So wasteful, so unnecessary. Anyone could see the game was over by that point. In fact, I was just about to issue an official surrender when they released those parachutes.” His eyes are glued on me, unblinking, so as not to miss a second of my reaction. But what he’s said makes no sense. When they released the parachutes? “Well, you really didn’t think I gave the order, did you? Forget the obvious fact that if I’d had a working hovercraft at my disposal, I’d have been using it to make an escape. But that aside, what purpose could it have served? We both know I’m not above killing children, but I’m not wasteful. I take life for very specific reasons. And there was no reason for me to destroy a pen full of Capitol children. None at all.”<br/>I wonder if the next fit of coughing is staged so that I can have time to absorb his words. He’s lying. Of course, he’s lying. But there’s something struggling to free itself from the lie as well.<br/>“However, I must concede it was a masterful move on Coin’s part. The idea that I was bombing our own helpless children instantly snapped whatever frail allegiance my people still felt to me. There was no real resistance after that. Did you know it aired live? You can see Plutarch’s hand there. And in the parachutes. Well, it’s that sort of thinking that you look for in a Head Gamemaker, isn’t it?” Snow dabs the corners of his mouth. “I’m sure he wasn’t gunning for your sister, but these things happen.”<br/>I’m not with Snow now. I’m in Special Weaponry back in 13 with Gale and Beetee. Looking at the designs based on Gale’s traps. That played on human sympathies. The first bomb killed the victims. The second, the rescuers. Remembering Gale’s words.<br/>“Beetee and I have been following the same rule book President Snow used when he hijacked Peeta.”<br/>“My failure,” says Snow, “was being so slow to grasp Coin’s plan. To let the Capitol and districts destroy one another, and then step in to take power with Thirteen barely scratched. Make no mistake, she was intending to take my place right from the beginning. I shouldn’t be surprised. After all, it was Thirteen that started the rebellion that led to the Dark Days, and then abandoned the rest of the districts when the tide turned against it. But I wasn’t watching Coin. I was watching you, Mockingjay. And you were watching me. I’m afraid we have both been played for fools.”<br/><br/>I refuse for this to be true. Some things even I can’t survive. I utter my first words since my sister’s death. “I don’t believe you.”<br/>Snow shakes his head in mock disappointment. “Oh</td>

<td>Out in the hall, I find Paylor standing in exactly the same spot. “Did you find what you were looking for?” she asks.<br/>I hold up the white bud in answer and then stumble past her. I must have made it back to my room, because the next thing I know, I’m filling a glass with water from the bathroom faucet and sticking the rose in it. I sink to my knees on the cold tile and squint at the flower, as the whiteness seems hard to focus on in the stark fluorescent light. My finger catches the inside of my bracelet, twisting it like a tourniquet, hurting my wrist. I’m hoping the pain will help me hang on to reality the way it did for Peeta. I must hang on. I must know the truth about what has happened.<br/>There are two possibilities, although the details associated with them may vary. First, as I’ve believed, that the Capitol sent in that hovercraft, dropped the parachutes, and sacrificed its children’s lives, knowing the recently arrived rebels would go to their aid. There’s evidence to support this. The Capitol’s seal on the hovercraft, the lack of any attempt to blow the enemy out of the sky, and their long history of using children as pawns in their battle against the districts. Then there’s Snow’s account. That a Capitol hovercraft manned by rebels bombed the children to bring a speedy end to the war. But if this was the case, why didn’t the Capitol fire on the enemy? Did the element of surprise throw them? Had they no defenses left? Children are precious to 13, or so it has always seemed. Well, not me, maybe. Once I had outlived my usefulness, I was expendable. Although I think it’s been a long time since I’ve been considered a child in this war. And why would they do it knowing their own medics would likely respond and be taken out by the second blast? They wouldn’t. They couldn’t. Snow’s lying. Manipulating me as he always has. Hoping to turn me against the rebels and possibly destroy them. Yes. Of course.<br/>Then what’s nagging at me? Those double-exploding bombs, for one. It’s not that the Capitol couldn’t have the same weapon, it’s just that I’m sure the rebels did. Gale and Beetee’s brainchild. Then there’s the fact that Snow made no escape attempt, when I know him to be the consummate survivor. It seems hard to believe he didn’t have a retreat somewhere, some bunker stocked with provisions where he could live out the rest of his snaky little life. And finally, there’s his assessment of Coin. What’s irrefutable is that she’s done exactly what he said. Let the Capitol and the districts run one another into the ground and then sauntered in to take power. Even if that was her plan, it doesn’t mean she dropped those parachutes. Victory was already in her grasp. Everything was in her grasp.<br/>Except me.<br/>I recall Boggs’s response when I admitted I hadn’t put much thought into Snow’s successor. “If your immediate answer isn’t Coin, then you’re a threat. You’re the face of the rebellion. You may have more influence than any other single person. Outwardly, the most you’ve ever done is tolerated her.”<br/>Suddenly, I’m thinking of Prim, who was not yet fourteen, not yet old enough to be granted the title of soldier, but somehow working on the front lines. How did such a thing happen? That my sister would have wanted to be there, I have no doubt. That she would be more capable than many older than she is a given. But for all that, someone very high up would have had to approve putting a thirteen-year-old in combat. Did Coin do it, hoping that losing Prim would push me completely over the edge? Or, at least, firmly on her side? I wouldn’t even have had to witness it in person. Numerous cameras would be covering the City Circle. Capturing the moment forever.<br/>No, now I am going crazy, slipping into some state of paranoia. Too many people would know of the mission. Word would get out. Or would it? Who would have to know besides Coin, Plutarch, and a small, loyal or easily disposable crew?<br/></td>

But while I think Haymitch might gamble with my life in the arena, I don’t think he’d rat me out to Coin. Whatever problems we may have with each other, we prefer resolving our differences one-on-one.<br/>I scramble off the tiles, out the door, and across the hall to his room. When there’s no response to my knock, I push inside. Ugh. It’s amazing how quickly he can defile a space.

I hear Haymitch calling me in the distance, but he won’t find me in his condition. Especially not in this new spot. Swathed in silk, I feel like a caterpillar in a cocoon awaiting metamorphosis. I always supposed that to be a peaceful condition. At first it is. But as I journey into night, I feel more and more trapped, suffocated by the slippery bindings, unable to emerge until I have transformed into something of beauty. I squirm, trying to shed my ruined body and unlock the secret to growing flawless wings. Despite enormous effort, I remain a hideous creature, fired into my current form by the blast from the bombs.<br/>The encounter with Snow opens the door to my old repertoire of nightmares. It’s like being stung by tracker jackers again. A wave of horrifying images with a brief respite I confuse with waking—only to find another wave knocking me back.

He makes a feeble attempt to get me to talk again but, seeing it’s pointless, sends me to a bath someone has drawn. The tub’s deep, with three steps to the bottom. I ease down into the warm water and sit, up to my neck in suds, hoping the medicines kick in soon. My eyes focus on the rose that has spread its petals overnight, filling the steamy air with its strong perfume. I rise and reach for a towel to smother it, when there’s a tentative knock and the bathroom door opens, revealing three familiar faces. They try to smile at me, but even Venia can’t conceal her shock at my ravaged mutt body. “Surprise!” Octavia squeaks, and then bursts into tears.

Unsure of where to go, they bump into one another a few times and then closet themselves in the bathroom. Gale comes up behind me and we examine each other’s reflection. I’m searching for something to hang on to, some sign of the girl and boy who met by chance in the woods five years ago and became inseparable. I’m wondering what would have happened to them if the Hunger Games had not reaped the girl. If she would have fallen in love with the boy, married him even. And sometime in the future, when the brothers and sisters had been raised up, escaped with him into the woods and left 12 behind forever. Would they have been happy, out in the wild, or would the dark, twisted sadness between them have grown up even without the Capitol’s help?<br/>“I brought you this.” Gale holds up a sheath.

Even now I can see the flash that ignites her, feel the heat of the flames. And I will never be able to separate that moment from Gale. My silence is my answer.<br/>“That was the one thing I had going for me. Taking care of your family,” he says. “Shoot straight, okay?” He touches my cheek and leaves. I want to call him back and tell him that I was wrong. That I’ll figure out a way to make peace with this. To remember the circumstances under which he created the bomb. Take into account my own inexcusable crimes. Dig up the truth about who dropped the parachutes. Prove it wasn’t the rebels. Forgive him. But since I can’t, I’ll just have to deal with the pain.</td>

You may cast your votes.”<br/>“No!” bursts out Peeta. “I vote no, of course! We can’t have another Hunger Games!”<br/>“Why not?” Johanna retorts. “It seems very fair to me. Snow even has a granddaughter. I vote yes.”<br/>“So do I,” says Enobaria, almost indifferently. “Let them have a taste of their own medicine.”<br/><br/>“This is why we rebelled! Remember?” Peeta looks at the rest of us. “Annie?”<br/>“I vote no with Peeta,” she says. “So would Finnick if he were here.”<br/>“But he isn’t, because Snow’s mutts killed him,” Johanna reminds her.<br/>“No,” says Beetee. “It would set a bad precedent. We have to stop viewing one another as enemies. At this point, unity is essential for our survival. No.”<br/>“We’re down to Katniss and Haymitch,” says Coin.<br/>Was it like this then? Seventy-five years or so ago? Did a group of people sit around and cast their votes on initiating the Hunger Games? Was there dissent? Did someone make a case for mercy that was beaten down by the calls for the deaths of the districts’ children? The scent of Snow’s rose curls up into my nose, down into my throat, squeezing it tight with despair. All those people I loved, dead, and we are discussing the next Hunger Games in an attempt to avoid wasting life. Nothing has changed. Nothing will ever change now.<br/>I weigh my options carefully, think everything through. Keeping my eyes on the rose, I say, “I vote yes…for Prim.”<br/>“Haymitch, it’s up to you,” says Coin.<br/>A furious Peeta hammers Haymitch with the atrocity he could become party to, but I can feel Haymitch watching me. This is the moment, then. When we find out exactly just how alike we are, and how much he truly understands me.<br/>“I’m with the Mockingjay,” he says.<br/><br/>“Excellent. That carries the vote,” says Coin. “Now we really must take our places for the execution.”<br/>As she passes me, I hold up the glass with the rose. “Can you see that Snow’s wearing this? Just over his heart?”<br/>Coin smiles. “Of course. And I’ll make sure he knows about the Games.”<br/>“Thank you,” I say.<br/>People sweep into the room, surround me. The last touch of powder, the instructions from Plutarch as I’m guided to the front doors of the mansion. The City Circle runs over, spills people down the side streets. The others take their places outside. Guards. Officials. Rebel leaders. Victors. I hear the cheers that indicate Coin has appeared on the balcony. Then Effie taps my shoulder, and I step out into the cold winter sunlight. Walk to my position, accompanied by the deafening roar of the crowd. As directed, I turn so they see me in profile, and wait. When they march Snow out the door, the audience goes insane. They secure his hands behind a post, which is unnecessary. He’s not going anywhere. There’s nowhere to go. This is not the roomy stage before the Training Center but the narrow terrace in front of the president’s mansion. No wonder no one bothered to have me practice. He’s ten yards away.<br/>I feel the bow purring in my hand. Reach back and grasp the arrow. Position it, aim at the rose, but watch his face. He coughs and a bloody dribble runs down his chin. His tongue flicks over his puffy lips. I search his eyes for the slightest sign of anything, fear, remorse, anger. But there’s only the same look of amusement that ended our last conversation. It’s as if he’s speaking the words again. “Oh, my dear Miss Everdeen. I thought we had agreed not to lie to each other.”<br/>He’s right. We did.<br/>The point of my arrow shifts upward. I release the string. And President Coin collapses over the side of the balcony and plunges to the ground. Dead.</td>

For her,” he says. “I thought we could plant them along the side of the house.”<br/>I look at the bushes, the clods of dirt hanging from their roots, and catch my breath as the word rose registers. I’m about to yell vicious things at Peeta when the full name comes to me. Not plain rose but evening primrose. The flower my sister was named for. I give Peeta a nod of assent and hurry back into the house, locking the door behind me. But the evil thing is inside, not out. Trembling with weakness and anxiety, I run up the stairs. My foot catches on the last step and I crash onto the floor. I force myself to rise and enter my room. The smell’s very faint but still laces the air. It’s there. The white rose among the dried flowers in the vase. Shriveled and fragile, but holding on to that unnatural perfection cultivated in Snow’s greenhouse. I grab the vase, stumble down to the kitchen, and throw its contents into the embers. As the flowers flare up, a burst of blue flame envelops the rose and devours it. Fire beats roses again. I smash the vase on the floor for good measure.</td>

I take in the claw marks from some wild animal, the back paw he holds slightly above the ground, the prominent bones in his face. He’s come on foot, then, all the way from 13. Maybe they kicked him out or maybe he just couldn’t stand it there without her, so he came looking.<br/>“It was the waste of a trip. She’s not here,” I tell him. Buttercup hisses again. “She’s not here. You can hiss all you like. You won’t find Prim.” At her name, he perks up. Raises his flattened ears. Begins to meow hopefully. “Get out!” He dodges the pillow I throw at him. “Go away! There’s nothing left for you here!” I start to shake, furious with him. “She’s not coming back! She’s never ever coming back here again!” I grab another pillow and get to my feet to improve my aim. Out of nowhere, the tears begin to pour down my cheeks. “She’s dead.” I clutch my middle to dull the pain. Sink down on my heels, rocking the pillow, crying. “She’s dead, you stupid cat. She’s dead.” A new sound, part crying, part singing, comes out of my body, giving voice to my despair. Buttercup begins to wail as well. No matter what I do, he won’t go. He circles me, just out of reach, as wave after wave of sobs racks my body, until eventually I fall unconscious. But he must understand. He must know that the unthinkable has happened and to survive will require previously unthinkable acts. Because hours later, when I come to in my bed, he’s there in the moonlight. Crouched beside me, yellow eyes alert, guarding me from the night.<br/>In the morning, he sits stoically as I clean the cuts, but digging the thorn from his paw brings on a round of those kitten mews. We both end up crying again, only this time we comfort each other. On the strength of this, I open the letter Haymitch gave me from my mother, dial the phone number, and weep with her as well. Peeta, bearing a warm loaf of bread, shows up with Greasy Sae. She makes us breakfast and I feed all my bacon to Buttercup.<br/>Slowly, with many lost days, I come back to life. I try to follow Dr. Aurelius’s advice, just going through the motions, amazed when one finally has meaning again. I tell him my idea about the book, and a large box of parchment sheets arrives on the next train from the Capitol.<br/>I got the idea from our family’s plant book. The place where we recorded those things you cannot trust to memory. The page begins with the person’s picture. A photo if we can find it. If not, a sketch or painting by Peeta. Then, in my most careful handwriting, come all the details it would be a crime to forget. Lady licking Prim’s cheek. My father’s laugh. Peeta’s father with the cookies. The color of Finnick’s eyes. What Cinna could do with a length of silk. Boggs reprogramming the Holo. Rue poised on her toes, arms slightly extended, like a bird about to take flight. On and on. We seal the pages with salt water and promises to live well to make their deaths count. Haymitch finally joins us, contributing twenty-three years of tributes he was forced to mentor. Additions become smaller. An old memory that surfaces. A late primrose preserved between the pages. </td>

Failure was guaranteed, but what made the project worthwhile was Leth’s resourcefulness and imagination (as well as his attempts to stretch the rules). Making a toaster from scratch is surely an impossible task, but not a pointless one. Thwaites’s project reveals much about the organisation of the modern world, not least the extent to which Britain’s industrial capacity has been dismantled. The country’s mines, foundries, and factories have become, it seems, another form of phantasmagoria.</td>

Big power stations can’t be adjusted up or down from hour to hour, and storing the quantities of energy they generate wasn’t (and generally still isn’t) practical or economical.

Oh dear, my mind wanders...<br/><br/>      I cycle to some remote woods with a deep lake, dismount my bicycle, and throw it in the lake. Then from my pocket I take a box of matches containing a single match, and a small bottle of petrol. I take off my shoes and all my clothes, pile them in a heap on the ground, pour on the petrol, carefully light my single match, and . . . I’m naked in the woods and I’m making a toaster, from scratch. As anyone who’s paid the slightest attention to Ray Mears’s BBC series Extreme Survival knows, the first thing to do in a survival situation is find shelter and water. Then food. Once those essentials are sorted out, I can begin the long process of making clothes and the first tools that eventually will lead to the creation of my electric toaster.<br/><br/>      But perhaps even this isn’t enough—the apple pie recipe of noted astrophysicist and archetypal 1980s science documentary presenter Dr. Carl Sagan rings in my ears: “If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.” The enormity of my task freezes me in my tracks.<br/><br/>      Luckily, my naked contemplation of Dr. Sagan is interrupted by some startled ramblers, who report me to the local constabulary. I’m apprehended and receive a caution for breaching the peace and a small fine for contravening bylaws by starting a fire in a national park. They do, however, give me a lift in their police car back to the real world...<br/><br/>      I’m making a toaster from scratch, and I live in London, in the United Kingdom, in the twenty-first century. I still want to sleep in my own bed, watch TV occasionally, and use the web to find stuff out, so I decide that from scratch means from the basic ingredients; that is, from the materials as they come out of the ground.</td>

<td>My second wrong-headed assumption was that because iron smelting is an old technique, it must be pretty simple for a modern, educated guy like me to master. The iron in iron ore is present as iron oxide: iron atoms bound with oxygen atoms. Oxygen and iron have quite an affinity for bonding; iron oxide is also called rust and, as we all know, things rust without us having to do anything to them. So, to rip the oxygen and iron apart requires a lot of energy, which is what you’re supplying by taking your furnace up to 1200 degrees Celsius. But to help things along, you also need to supply something more attractive than iron for the oxygen to bond with, something “reducing,” like carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide can be made by incompletely oxidising things containing carbon—say, by burning fossilised trees with only a limited supply of oxygen. For</td>

<td>When crude oil is sucked out of the ground, it’s a mixture of hundreds of different types of hydrocarbon molecules—carbon atoms joined in chains of various lengths with hydrogen atoms sprouting off. The size of these molecules range from extremely short (just a handful of atoms) to molecules with perhaps thirty carbon atoms in them. The job of an oil refinery is to separate the different sizes of molecules. A mixture of just the larger, heavier molecules is a viscous sludge known as asphalt and used to make roads. The midsized molecules, like hexane (six carbon atoms) and octane (eight), make up much of the liquid that we call petrol.<br/><br/>      As crude oil bubbles to the surface, the smallest molecules in the mixture are things like methane, ethane and propane, and ethylene and propylene. They’re so small (one or two carbon atoms long) that they’re gasses at normal temperature and pressure. This could pose a problem for me because it’s propylene that I need.<br/><br/>      Also, only a fraction of crude oil is propylene, so I’d need to collect rather a lot to make a decent amount of plastic. However, using a process called cracking, the larger molecules can be split apart to make more of the smaller molecules that I’m after. And then, using a process called supercracking, smaller molecules like methane can be joined together to get even more of the propylene I need. So, once I get my crude, the problem I face will be how to separate off just the type of molecule I want—propylene—and then how to crack as much as possible of the rest into more of it.<br/><br/>      Once I’ve got my propylene gas I need to turn it into solid polypropylene plastic. This happens when at least a thousand of the small propylene molecules link together in a chain, giving you a giant sticky molecule of polypropylene. Millions of these molecules all twisted round each other are what we see when we look at that shiny plastic case.<br/><br/>      To get the propylene molecules to join together (polymerise) you need to cause a chain reaction in the gas. To do this one must heat the propylene to about 100 degrees Celsius while also pressurising it to about 200 pounds per square inch (psi)—about thirteen times atmospheric pressure. To start the chain reaction going, you need an initiator of “free radicals”—these are single electrons that react with (or oxidise) just about everything (including the molecules in our cells, which is why those of us who want to live forever should eat plenty of antioxidant containing face cream). Free radicals could be provided by some UV rays, or some hot hydrogen peroxide. You also need a special catalyst to keep the polymerisation regular.</td>

<td>BP: Hello, BP press office. How can I help you?†<br/><br/>      ME: Hi, my name’s Thomas Thwaites, I’m a student at the Royal College of Art in London. I was wondering if I could speak to someone about a project I’m doing...<br/><br/>      Hold on while I put you through please. [brief silence] Hello, Robert speaking.<br/><br/>      Hi, Robert, my name’s Thomas Thwaites, I’m a student at the Royal College of Art in London.<br/><br/>      Hello.<br/><br/>      I’m calling because I’m undertaking this project and I was hoping BP might be interested in getting involved. You see, I’m trying to make a toaster.<br/><br/>      Err. Right.<br/><br/>      The thing is, I’m making it from scratch. That is, starting from raw materials. So before Christmas I went to an iron mine, and got some iron ore. I smelted it and now I’m forming it into the bars of the grill to make a toaster.<br/><br/>      I see. And where exactly does BP fit into this?<br/><br/>      Well, the casing of a toaster is plastic, and so is the moulding of the plug, and the insulation of the power cord. And plastic comes from oil, right?<br/><br/>      Err yes.<br/><br/>      And BP drills for oil, right?<br/><br/>      Yes.<br/><br/>      So I was wondering if I might be able to come and hop on one of your helicopters to one of your oil rigs and pick up maybe a jug of oil?<br/><br/>      I see. It’s not a trivial thing to take a helicopter to an oil rig.<br/><br/>      I know, I just thought that you must have them going out there all the time, and so if there was a spare seat I could just sort of tag along.<br/><br/>      We don’t have spare seats in our helicopters. It’s just not something you can do casually. Everyone who goes out has to do emergency training. The course takes a couple of days... [muffled speech in the background] No, I’ve just been told it now takes a week.<br/><br/>      Right... [I vaguely remember seeing something like it on Blue Peter, a long-running children’s BBC television show. It looked quite exciting]... I’ve got a week.<br/><br/>      You do know that there was a helicopter crash in the North Sea last week?<br/><br/>      No, sorry, I didn’t know that.<br/><br/>      There was. They all got out because they’d done the training course. As I say, it’s not a casual undertaking. The other thing is that crude oil isn’t a benevolent substance. In fact, it’s highly dangerous and we never allow it on helicopters. Especially not in a jug.<br/><br/>      Maybe a jerry can? Maybe it could go by boat?<br/><br/>      We’re just not set up for the kind of scale you’re working at. If you wanted a tankerful, we could maybe help, but...<br/><br/>      It would be great PR for BP...<br/><br/>      In what way?<br/><br/>      Well, my project has been blogged, a journalist from the New York Times got in touch, Wired magazine, there’s even an article in Hemispheres, the in-flight magazine of United Airlines.<br/><br/>      I don’t think BP would fit into this. It sounds like your story rather than BP’s.<br/><br/>      It could be BP’s story too... You know, “BP a multinational corporation helps person make a toaster” sort of thing.<br/><br/>      Yeah. Not sure. I can’t really think of a way to do this. Look, let me have a talk with some of my colleagues and if we can think of an angle we’ll give you a call back.<br/><br/>      Great. Robert, you won’t regret it. My number is...<br/><br/>      † It’s not polite to record people’s phone conversations without telling them (it’s also mildly illegal), so I didn’t record this conversation, and so this isn’t a direct transcription, but you get the picture...<br/><br/>      <br/><br/>      While I waited for BP to get its act together, I set about making the mould I would need to form the plastic into a casing. The usual moulds for making toaster cases are incredibly expensive engineered pieces of steel, because they have to withstand hot plastic being injected into their cavities at extremely high pressures, and then cool evenly so the plastic doesn’t distort as it solidifies. I’m going to make my mould from wood.<br/><br/>      Carving requires a hammer, a chisel, a block of wood, and a lot of patience. Across the road in the park some tree surgeons were conveniently chopping down a tree because, coincidentally, it was mouldy. I secured two big lumps from the trunk and set about carving a positive and a negative that, when slotted together, would leave a toaster casing–shaped cavity.</td>

I expect Robert has a lot on his plate now, but perhaps he’d be a bit keener on a jolly man-makes-toaster story to help counteract all that negative coverage. Perhaps not.

The lactic acid comes from bacteria-fermenting sugarcane. I remember that lactic acid buildup is what makes our muscles sore when we exercise. I quickly dismiss the idea of vigorous aerobics followed by somehow harvesting the lactic acid from my muscles as just a bit horrible.<br/><br/>      It’s even possible to make standard polyethylene from sugarcane rather than crude oil.

<td>Subject: Re: Toaster Project and Plastics?<br/><br/>      Hi Thomas,<br/><br/>      I think you need to understand the complexity of plastic production; it is considerably more complex than metal production.<br/><br/>      The complexity comes from the level of processing; metals are refined at the physical level through heating and cooling etc., as you know. Plastics, on the other hand, are processed through a combination of physical and molecular transformations (the breaking and reforming of molecular bonds). The chemical transformations require strict control of temperature, pressure, mixtures of chemicals, and the use of catalysts (in themselves difficult to make).<br/><br/>      It takes a number of steps required to produce any plastic. Polyethylene, probably one of the simplest polymers, requires several steps to produce and the plastic used for toasters, PBT, requires a minimum of six chemical transformations to produce. I hope this is not too depressing and I’m happy to discuss it further. We had a good discussion in the office trying to think of a solution to the problem and came up with something you could try and make.<br/><br/>      Going back to the complexity of the production I would offer the following view: We’ve been making iron since the Iron age,but we’ve only been making plastic for ~100 years (most only for 60 years). The time it took us to go from iron to plastic indicates the difference in complexity.<br/><br/>      Regards,<br/><br/>      Adrian<br/><br/>      </td>

<td>This situation requires some lateral thinking. In the discipline of geology, a debate is currently raging over whether or not to declare the beginning of a new epoch—the Anthropocene—a geological age of humanity’s own making. This would be quite a big deal in geological circles, as epochs don’t begin every year—generally more like every few million. The reason a new one is being considered is that geologists in the far future, without any knowledge of our civilisation, would notice sharp changes in the strata of rock that are being laid down today. They would be able to say there had been a mass extinction event (i.e., human society), as fossils of many species would suddenly disappear from the fossil record. A sudden increase in radioactivity would be detected—left over from the two thousand or so nuclear weapons we’ve exploded since 1945, and “new” molecules would be found in ice cores and rocks, molecules from plastics. Just as rocks have been laid down during previous epochs, could it not be argued that equivalent rocks are being laid down in the Anthropocene, and that some of these rocks happen to be made of polypropylene, for instance? If I can mine iron ore, can I not “mine” some of this nascent plastic rock at a dump?<br/><br/>      I admit that it’s a stretch, but they’re my rules and I’ll break them if I want to.<br/><br/>      Axion</td>

<td>The thing about recycling is that it’s easy to lose quality with each cycle by getting different materials inadvertently mixed together. If you melt down some high-grade aluminium, perhaps parts of an old aeroplane, but some copper wiring gets mixed in too, then the resultant aluminium won’t be good enough to be used for aeroplane parts again. So it’s used for cans, say, but if these cans are carelessly recycled too, even more impurities are added, and so on for the next cycle, until the metal is so mixed up that no one trusts it enough to use it in their products, so it goes to the dump. This sort of recycling has been called downcycling— with each cycle the quality of the material goes down, as does the range of things you can use it for, until it’s so bad that no one wants it.<br/><br/>      This is even more of a problem for plastics. Plastics are difficult to tell apart and so difficult to separate automatically, but they’re especially susceptible to contamination: getting a bit of high-density polyethylene mixed in with your batch of polypropylene can ruin it completely. Compounding this is the fact that plastics are relatively cheap, so at the moment it’s difficult to make the necessary sorting out pay. In other words, your lovely plastic patio chair made from 100 percent recycled plastic could just be having a quick stop over at your house while on its way, inevitably, to the dump.<br/><br/>      Electrical goods</td>

Therefore, in theory, the manufacturers could save themselves a bit of money in the end if, in the first place, they designed their products so that they could easily dismantle them and sort all the components and materials into nice separate piles that could be reused or recycled. Thus while acting entirely in the interests of saving themselves some money, the invisible hand of the market would guide these companies to make products that were less environmentally harmful.<br/><br/>      This led to lots of interesting ideas about how you could design things to be easily and quickly (and therefore cheaply) disassembled. For example, Nokia made a mobile phone that would spring itself apart in the right conditions, and screws were developed that would actually unscrew themselves if heated to the right temperature. Maybe they would start using standardised components to save themselves more money, making it far easier for parts to be reused rather than melted down and reformed. Even better, as it’s expensive to handle toxic materials, the manufacturers would have the incentive to design out those materials right at the start.<br/><br/>      The dream was that the WEEE would lead to closed-loop manufacturing. The manufacturers would have a constant incentive to make products that were easier to recycle, because they were the ones that would have to recycle them. This was what was going to happen when the WEEE legislation was first proposed. The problem is, after years of delays in setting up the scheme, Axion Recycling and its competitors aren’t dealing with TVs that ping apart into their components at the shake of a stick. They deal with sacks of mixed-up bits of shredded plastics, metals, rubber, glass, or whatever else the electrical goods we throw away happen to be made of. The way the WEEE has been implemented means that Sony (or whoever) just has to purchase a certificate from “equipment recyclers” saying that a certain proportion of electrical goods has been recycled. So if Sony sells a third of all the TVs that year in Europe, it just has to buy certificates to prove it has contributed a third of the money to a recycling scheme for TVs. But Sony doesn’t actually have to deal with recycling its own TVs, which means it has no incentive to design them to be easily recycled or reused, it just needs to hand over some cash. This “recycler” (which, according to Keith, quite often could just be a repurposed car-crushing yard) crushes and shreds all the TVs, toasters, microwaves, or whatever, sucks out some of the magnetic metals, sucks out some of the nonmagnetic metals like copper and aluminium, and then puts what’s left in a big bag labelled “plastic.” This label is somewhat simplistic, however, because although the bag does contain plastic (of many different types, mixed together) it also contains glass, rubber, and whatever metal was missed earlier. All this is then sent either to the dump, to a company like Axion, or to Axion’s competitors; these are the poorest of the poor in the developing world who pick through mixtures of waste, separating out different components and materials. As Keith succinctly puts it: “The legislators ballsed it up.”<br/><br/>      <br/>        </td>

<td>Professor Cilliers was advising me about extractive metallurgical techniques. His particular specialisation is bubbles. More specifically, bubbles in foam. I am rather astounded to hear that the study of bubbles is a fitting one for the Chair in Mineral Processing at the Royal School of Mines, but this is the world we live in. “Froth flotation” is a process used to separate sand and other bits of rocky stuff from the metal in crushed-up ore. As I understand it, you crush your ore to a powder, add it to a big vat of water with some vegetable oil in it, and mix vigorously. This produces a foam on the top. Most of the tiny bits of metal stick to the bubbles, but the rest of the sand and clay or whatever doesn’t. So you get these shiny metallic bubbles that you scoop off and send for smelting. It’s probably slightly more complex than that (complex enough for it to become the basis of Professor Cilliers’s career anyway), but that’s the general idea. On the scale that these plants process ore, if he can adjust the process so even just a fraction of a percent more copper sticks to the bubbles and is scooped off rather than remaining in the dregs, that fraction of a percent multiplies up to thousands of tonnes of extra copper, and millions of dollars more for whoever is selling it.<br/><br/>      I suppose Professor Cilliers not having to spend much time toasting his bread in the morning is one small contributing factor to the reason why he has time to become an expert in bubbles, and in studying bubbles he makes mining copper more efficient, which in turn makes toasters cheaper, which means more people can devote less time to making their toast and more time to other activities, like going to art school and doing ridiculous things like taking nine months to make a single toaster from scratch.</td>

<td>Ehrlich was one of the authors of a best-selling book published in 1968 called The Population Bomb. It predicted famines engulfing whole continents in the 1970s, caused by over-population and the exhaustion of natural resources. Simon challenged Ehrlich and friends to put their money where their mouths were, and pick five different natural resources that would be scarcer in ten years’ time. This scarcity would be reflected in the price—if the prices of their five materials rose over the ten years, then Simon would pay the difference to Ehrlich and the gang, whereas if the prices fell, Ehrlich would have to pay Simon the difference. Ehrlich and his colleagues chose five metals—chromium, copper, nickel, tin, and tungsten—and the period 1980 to 1990. At the time of the bet they said that they’d “accept Simon’s astonishing offer before other greedy people jump in,” as the “lure of easy money can be irresistible.”<br/><br/>      It’s 1990. I’d been alive for ten years. Home Alone was on at the cinema, Windows 3.0 was out, somewhere in CERN the first “World Wide Web” page was put up, and the real prices of chromium, copper, nickel, tin, and tungsten have all fallen (the “real price” is the price after general inflation has been taken into account). Ehrlich and the gang are gutted, and amongst a lot of embarrassing efforts to get out of it, hand over a cheque for $578.00, the combined fall in price of all five metals.<br/><br/>      </td>

They know this because they found a shaft sunk from the surface with charred bits of wood at the bottom that they had carbon-dated to 4000 BP (before present), the Bronze Age in Britain. Back then people didn’t have pickaxes or explosives, so they dug these shafts and lit hot fires at the bottom, and poured over water to crack the rock. Then they had to smash it up further with stone boulders to break up the bits containing copper. Sounds like hard work</td>

<td>After about fifteen minutes of walking (mostly at a crouch), we reach the descriptively named “brown pool.” This is a domed chamber, about ten metres across, that’s home to the aforementioned pool of water. Its colour suggests it is highly contaminated, so David suggests filling the mineral water containers here. Each one has “Only to be used for mineral water” stamped into the plastic on the neck. “Well, technically,” I think to myself, “I am filling them with mineral water, only these minerals are toxic and/or present in rather higher concentrations than your average bottle of Evian.”<br/><br/>      The water is reddy brown and has a pH of about 2; this is the strongest acidity that’s found naturally. The chemistry is “complex,” as David says, but the reason the water is so acidic is that it has reacted with the rock exposed by the mining. This acidification occurs wherever water and air come into contact with the type of rock that can contain metals—so not only in the mine itself, but also on the surface in pools between the tailings dumps, the vast heaps of crushed up waste rock. I ask if the acid would strip me to the bone if I fall in—no, but it would sting a lot if it got into my eyes. Nothing can survive in it, except a type of organism so bizarre that no one even thought it existed until they discovered some happily living in the geothermal vents at Yellowstone Park in the 1970s. These microbes, called “extremophiles,” not only survive in extreme conditions like acidic water or hot tar, they thrive in them. In fact, the extremophile microbes living in mines contribute massively to the acidification of the water by slowly “eating” the rock and excreting acid. They are studied by astrobiologists, because it’s imagined the extreme conditions they live in may be similar to environments found on other planets.</td>

I reckon I need around one hundred grammes of copper to make the pins of the plug and the electrical wiring. A teaspoonful of copper would weigh 44.6 grammes (in the United Kingdom at least—in the United States it would weigh less because spoons there are slightly smaller). This means 11,210 teaspoons of mine water should contain the one hundred grammes of copper I need for my toaster, or using more standard units, about fifty-six litres. Which is why I’ve come to the mine with the biggest water bottles I could find, twenty litres each. Each filled bottle weighs about twenty kilogrammes, which is very heavy to hold in one hand while having to use the other to climb up slippery 150-year-old ladders. David, who isn’t quite as reckless as me, decides it would be foolhardy to attempt.<br/><br/>      There is a backup plan, however.<br/><br/>      There are pools on the surface amongst the tailings dumps that also have copper dissolved in them, but at slightly lower concentrations, meaning less copper for my toaster. Still, it seems it really is our only choice. We fill up two smaller containers with the good stuff from the brown pool and return to the strange but quite beautiful surface landscape of Parys Mountain.</td>

Quite an interesting project—I wish you good luck. I found your “Toaster Project” site from a link on the Pebble Limited Partnership website (www.pebblepartnership.com). The proposed Pebble project is a massive open pit gold and copper mine located in the most wild Sockeye salmon fishery in the world. I work with a coalition of commercial and sport fishermen, Alaska indigenous peoples and other locals opposed to the proposal. Given your interest in avoiding becoming a “how it is made” industry promotional project, I thought you’d be interested in Pebble’s (UK’s Anglo America) promotion of your website. You might consider how this might impact your project. As an aside . . . I’d gladly give up toast if it would help safeguard this wonderful place.<br/><br/>      Matt<br/><br/>      From: Thomas Thwaites &lt;thomas@thomasthwaites.com&gt;<br/>      To: Matt Davidson &lt;b————@gmail.com&gt;<br/>      Date: Monday, February 23, 2009 9:22 AM<br/>      Subject: Re: greetings from Alaska...<br/><br/>      Thanks for the heads up Matt,<br/><br/>      It’s slightly bizarre to be put on their website . . . which is quite gross... especially all the holding hands mosaic whales etc. (the designer should be seriously ashamed). I’ve saved a copy of the website for possible use later...<br/><br/>      “The Toaster Project” is really a work in progress which got blogged prematurely. Some people (like Pebble) have missed the critical angle... the ridiculousness of churning out thousands (millions?) of toasters and other products at the expense of the environment and human sanity (the cheap toasters I’ve taken apart have been hand soldered). However, there is also clearly a ridiculousness in undertaking to make a toaster myself, an activity that will produce a single toaster with a far larger carbon footprint than any toaster bought from the shops. It’s kind of disturbing to be faced with the reality of the ambiguous “position” of the project though...<br/><br/>      I guess I want to argue against both positions stemming exclusively from the demand side (consumers demand toasters therefore copper therefore open cast mines in remote wilderness), and the supply side (e.g. to argue that mineral extraction is wrong... then to go and make some toast).<br/><br/>      As you say, you would give up toast to protect Bristol Bay... if only it were that simple. With your permission could I publish this correspondence (if I do, I’ll happily include the link to your campaign).<br/><br/>      All the best,<br/><br/>      Thomas<br/><br/>      Pondering this later I come to the conclusion that you’ve got to stop somewhere. The thing about mining is that you’re digging big holes in the ground. Big holes in the ground have a tendency to fill up with water—particularly in wet places such as near to the head-waters of Alaskan rivers. The water in these holes will become acidic—particularly so due to the high sulphur content of the Pebble prospect ore. In fact, if the mine were to be named for what it primarily would be excavating, it’d be called a sulphur mine (with a little copper mixed in). Sulphuric acid and Alaskan wilderness do not mix well, and the problem of how to stop them from mixing would remain for centuries after the mine is exhausted.<br/><br/>      Metals will be valuable for the foreseeable future, and presumably extraction techniques will continue to improve, meaning more and more ore deposits of lower and lower grades will become economical to mine, meaning the “market” will demand to mine them. The pressure to open up more sites to exploitation is therefore not going to diminish. But unless you apply the brakes at some point, we could end up living in one big mine, so to speak. Also, unless we apply the brakes there won’t be much incentive to come up with less environmentally damaging ways of doing things. The Pebble Project would seem to me to be a good place to stop.<br/><br/>      www.savebristolbay.org</td>

<td>There is a large nickel mine in Siberia, in a place called Norilsk. This is Siberia’s northernmost city, sited on top of one of the largest nickel ore deposits in the world. For a city to exist in such a harsh climate (the average temperature is minus ten degrees Centigrade, with blizzards for 110 days a year) it needs a pretty good reason. The exploitation of the nickel deposit has provided one since the 1930s, though much of the exploitation until 1953 (perhaps even as late as the 1970s) was done by the forced labour of political prisoners, sentenced (either with or without a trial) to mine nickel in incredibly dire and often fatal conditions. Nowadays, Norilsk has the slightly less (or more?) dubious honour of being one of the ten most polluted places in the world (as listed by the New York environmental NGO, the Blacksmith Institute). The smelting of the nickel ore is done on-site, and because of the plumes of sulphur dioxide released in the process, allegedly not a single tree grows for fifty kilometres around the smelting complex, and the topsoil itself has become so contaminated with heavy metals that it would now be economical to mine as well. Sounds rather bleak.<br/><br/>      It is a rather difficult place to go without a very </td>

<td>My blog exposure has led to an interesting nickel contact however—someone with connections to the Talvivaara Mining Company, which is just starting to mine a large deposit of nickel ore in the far north of Finland. However (according to the Talvivaara PLC website), the extraction of nickel from the ore won’t happen in the usual way—that is, smelting it in a fur-nace and emitting plumes of acid-rain-causing sulphur dioxide-—but in a more environmentally benign way, using a process called “bio-heap leaching.” This involves heaping the crushed ore in a big pile and then using a variety of the same extremophile microbes that cause the water pollution problems at mines like Parys Mountain or Rio Tinto to actually extract the metal. A mixture of acid and extremophile, acid-loving bacteria, is sprayed onto the heaps and trickles through, the bacteria digesting the ore into more acid, sulphates, and nickel. The acid leaches out further nickel, and the whole nickel-rich liquid is collected in channels running under the heaps. One then has only to precipitate out the metal dissolved in the acid solution and voilà—all without so much unpleasant burning of fossilised trees and production of noxious gasses. Excellent, I think, bio-heap leaching is the kind of clever win-win solution us modern humans come up with these days: we get nickel for our toasters, and our bacterial partners and co-inhabitants of Spaceship Earth get a good square meal. Except, as it turns out, it’s not that simple. The metal products produced at Talvivaara still need to be smelted in the end. The reason bio-heap leaching had to be employed is because the ore mined at Talvivaara is of such a low grade—the concentration of metal is so low—that it wouldn’t have been economical to smelt, unless a cheap way was found to concentrate it first. This nascent technology of bio-heap leaching has found its first application in making un-exploitable ore worth exploiting</td>

<td>Talvivaara has signed a ten-year contract to sell its nickel product (that is, concentrated nickel liquid) to none other than Norilsk Nickel. However, it’s not shipped all the way to the end of the world at Norilsk in Siberia. MMC Norilsk Nickel Group also own a nickel smelting plant at Harjavalta, in southern Finland. Unlike Norilsk, Harjavalta is not one of the ten most polluted places in the world. In fact, the smelting plant at Harjavalta has been studied as an example of an “industrial ecosystem.” Just as in natural ecosystems, where the waste products from one organism are the food source of another, the idea at Harjavalta is that the waste products of one industrial process form the raw material inputs for another. The idea of an industrial ecosystem is relatively new, and is an eco-system by analogy only, but it certainly seems like a move in the right direction. It’s interesting that although both are owned by the same company, Norilsk Nickel’s two smelting plants are polar opposites in terms of their environmental impact. Russia and Finland are also polar opposites in terms of their regulatory environments—one being one of the most corrupt countries in the world, the other one of the least.<br/><br/>      Google</td>

<td>they are children of the sun who come into the ceremony with no knowledge of society or human morality. In some of their early skits, they seem depraved, shattering the rules of decency and decorum. They eat filth from the ground, steal from one another, simulate sex. Since they don’t know the rules, anything goes. But over the following day and a half, their understanding advances, and they seem to acquire the basics of ethical behavior. In short, they are taught to be more Hopi.<br/>			 In the process, they teach people about what’s acceptable, what isn’t. “They are the great commentators of the world,” says Whiteley. “They’ll call out transgressive behavior.” And for this they employ shame.<br/>			 In one ceremony Whiteley recalls from the 1990s, the clowns acted like comical drunks, staggering and throwing bottles around as they ridiculed a bootlegger, a man known as Cricket, who was selling liquor within the community, which violated an established rule. The alcohol he supplied was a poison developed by outsiders, and it endangered the health of the tribe. The shaming Cricket received was intense, Whiteley says. “He must have had pretty thick skin.” It sent a sharp message not only to him but to the entire group. Someone thinking about bootlegging would now think twice.<br/>			 The clowns’ shaming of community members doesn’t end with the laughs and jibes. Later in the ceremony, both the clowns and their shamed targets can receive formal forgiveness. With that, the shamed return to the tribe in good standing—though always aware that the others will be keeping an eye on them.<br/>			 A day or two of ridicule and then redemption. This was pretty tame stuff compared to the dark and painful stories I’d been hearing about. And next to my own lifelong battle with fat shame, it seemed like coaxing rather than bullying. The Hopi ceremony, as Whiteley described it, doesn’t tell the transgressors that they’re bad people, or losers, only that they need to make a course correction.<br/>			 How the Pueblo clowns taunt their targets tells us something about the role of shame in society.

The headpieces are trimmed with corn husks.<br/>			 These rituals have many layers of meaning, she explained. They’re tied to religion, and it’s such a sensitive subject that participants are discouraged from discussing it with outsiders.<br/>			 I followed up with Peter Whiteley. He’s the curator of North American Ethnology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, and much of his anthropological research has focused on the traditions of the Hopi. This tribe has lived in northeastern Arizona for a millennium in fixed settlements, which is why the Spaniards, when they arrived in the sixteenth century, included the Hopi as one of the peoples they called Pueblo, the Spanish word for town.<br/>			 The function of the shame clowns, Whiteley says, is to reinforce the norms and ethical standards of the community. In seasonal ceremonies, which extend over two days, the clowns dressed in clay-striped costumes perform in a plaza surrounded by community members. The premise is that </td>

In interviews on Christian programs and in the three books she has written, she gives thanks to God for her recovery. And it is true that faith, along with the backing of a religious community, can provide valuable support to people struggling with addiction.<br/>			 Yet the impression left by her story reinforces the myths that sustain the poisonous punching-down status quo. It would seem that a woman who had made a long series of poor choices—opting for pregnancies, drugs, abusive friends and lovers—found a way to turn the corner. Through the strength of her will and her faith she swung from the wrong decisions to the right ones. If only more people would follow her path to salvation!<br/>			 Blossom is a survivor. She’s a remarkable person with a special spirit. However, inspiring stories like Blossom’s are the exception, not the rule, and that’s the point. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be noteworthy. They also fit our agenda. If Blossom manages to reclaim her life, the thinking goes, others can too. It’s up to them. No need for us to empathize, much less help them. In fact, we can continue to punch down on them mercilessly, feeling righteous in our choices while shaming them for theirs. We can consign them to the slums and jails we never see. And when they’re ready to change their shameful ways, well, they’re on their own.<br/></td>

<td>During those years, my shame didn’t result from a stand-alone event, like farting in the lunchroom or flunking a history test. It was a chronic condition. I arranged my life, from the clothes I wore to the activities I’d agree to do with friends, to protect myself from shameful episodes, like the weighing scene in the gym, or much later, the confrontation in the bodega. I allowed myself to buy clothes only after I’d dieted successfully for a few weeks, which meant all my clothes were always uncomfortably tight. I kept them that way to punish myself for gaining the weight back. The result was that in addition to being fat, I became chronically uncomfortable and self-punishing.</td>

<td>Yet many recovery programs are anchored in shame, blaming people for their addictions, even as studies warn that such an approach is counterproductive. Psychology researchers at UCLA divided seventy-seven cigarette smokers into two groups and gave each participant eight cigarettes, a lighter, and an ashtray. They were offered monetary awards for resisting the temptation during the hour they were left alone.<br/>			 One of these groups, however, was exposed to negative stereotypes collected from anti-smoking campaigns. They were subjected to explicit shame that questioned their willpower and dedication to health.<br/>			 The group exposed to the stigmatizing messages lit up earlier. Seventy percent of them started smoking within twenty minutes compared to 40 percent of the control group. The researchers theorize that the smokers were responding to so-called stereotype threat. When this happens, people’s worries and fears overwhelm their minds—deflecting their efforts to counteract the stereotypes.<br/></td>

<td>evidence could steer them away from losing formulas. Shame muddled their thinking and instilled false hopes. Instead of blaming the diets, they blamed themselves—and me.<br/>			 To our human problem-solving nature, diets just make so much sense. The numbers seem to add up. And they also fit neatly into traditional Western values. If you suffer and endure the hardships of hunger, a thin body is your recompense. Being thin, after all, is viewed as a choice. Having made the right one, which is difficult and requires discipline and righteousness, you can strut your narrow waist size to signal virtue. You can have pride, which in terms of psychic suffering is the polar opposite of shame.<br/>			 Trouble is, diets rarely “work”—at least when the promise is to transform a fat person into a thin one forever. For most obese people, diets hurt more than they help. After sifting through voluminous records from the final quarter of the twentieth century, UCLA researchers found that between one-third and two-thirds of people who lost weight while dieting did not just regain the pounds in short order. They piled on more. The question for most dieters wasn’t whether the lost pounds would return, the researchers wrote, but only how long it would take.<br/></td>

<td>Throughout this grim drama, as my hopes to transform myself rose and then crashed, I overlooked one stubborn detail: My parents had been dieting, on and off, for years, and they were still overweight. They believed devoutly in the apparently scientific grounding of diets. They had tried dozens of them over the years: They counted calories; they tried low fat, low sugar, high bran. (In their desperation, they sometimes strayed from science. My mom briefly experimented with an olive oil diet, which called for a spoonful every time she felt hungry. The idea was to punish yourself for being hungry. A few weeks later I called and asked how it was going but she’d forgotten all about it.) After many promising beginnings, all these diets came to nothing.<br/>			 I was too young to understand the hypocrisy of two overweight parents pushing their child to succeed where they’d failed. And it certainly didn’t occur to me until much later that like me they were ashamed. When I failed in my diet, they pretended it never happened, because my stumbles were shadows of their own.<br/></td>

Too damaged to sell in even the worst of times, and this was to be his reaping shirt? This morning he had gone to her room at daybreak, only to find both his cousin and the shirt missing. Not a good sign. Had Tigris given up on the old thing and braved the black market in some last-ditch effort to find him proper clothing? And what on earth would she possess worth trading for it? Only one thing — herself — and the house of Snow had not yet fallen that far. Or was it falling now as he salted the cabbage?<br/><br/>He thought of people putting a price on her.

<td>Coryo!” Tigris cried out, and he slammed the phone down. The nickname she’d given him when he was a newborn had stuck. He flew out of the kitchen, almost knocking her over, but she was too excited to reproach him. “I did it! I did it! Well, I did something.” Her feet did a rapid little run in place as she held up a hanger draped in an old dress bag. “Look, look, look!”<br/><br/>Coriolanus unzipped the bag and stripped it from the shirt.<br/><br/>It was gorgeous. No, even better, it was classy. The thick linen was neither the original white nor the yellow of age, but a delicious cream. The cuffs and collar had been replaced with black velvet, and the buttons were gold and ebony cubes. Tesserae. Each had two tiny holes drilled through it for the thread.<br/><br/>“You’re brilliant,” he said earnestly. “And the best cousin ever.” Careful to hold the shirt out of harm’s way, he hugged her with his free arm. “Snow lands on top!”<br/><br/>“Snow lands on top!” Tigris crowed. It was the saying that had gotten them through the war, when it was a constant struggle not to be ground into the earth.<br/><br/>“Tell me everything,” he said, knowing she would want to. She so loved to talk clothes.<br/><br/>Tigris threw up her hands and gave a breathy laugh. “Where to begin?”<br/><br/>She began with the bleach. Tigris had suggested the white curtains in Fabricia’s bedroom looked dingy and, while soaking them in bleach water, had slipped in the shirt. It had responded beautifully, but no amount of soaking could entirely erase the stains. So she’d boiled the shirt with dead marigolds she’d found in the bin outside Fabricia’s neighbor’s, and the blossoms had dyed the linen just enough to conceal the stains. The velvet for the cuffs was from a large drawstring pouch that had held some now-meaningless plaque of their grandfather’s. The tesserae she had pried from the interior of a cabinet in the maid’s bathroom. She’d gotten the building maintenance man to drill the holes in exchange for mending his coveralls.</td>

Strands of her thin, white hair poked from the bottom of a rusty velvet turban.

She snipped away at the rose, preserving a bit of greenery, and pinned it to his shirt. “It does look elegant. You know what her roses mean to her. Thank her.”<br/><br/>So he did.

<td>There would be twenty-four tributes, one boy and one girl from each of the twelve defeated districts, drawn by lottery to be thrown into an arena to fight to the death in the Hunger Games. It was all laid out in the Treaty of Treason that had ended the Dark Days of the districts’ rebellion, one of the many punishments borne by the rebels. As in the past, the tributes would be dumped into the Capitol Arena, a now-dilapidated amphitheater that had been used for sports and entertainment events before the war, along with some weapons to murder one another. Viewing was encouraged in the Capitol, but a lot of people avoided it. How to make it more engaging was the challenge.<br/><br/>With this in mind, for the first time the tributes were to be assigned mentors. Twenty-four of the Academy’s best and brightest seniors had been tapped for the job. The specifics of what this entailed were still being worked out. There was talk of preparing each tribute for a personal interview, maybe some grooming for the cameras.

Mayor Lipp, a squat, freckled man in a hopelessly outdated suit, stood between two burlap sacks. He dug his hand deeply in the bag on his left, pulled out a slip of paper, and barely glanced at it.<br/><br/>“The District Twelve girl tribute is Lucy Gray Baird,” he said into a mic.

The dip of her hand into the ruffles at her hip, the wriggle of bright green transported from her pocket and deposited down the collar of a smirking redhead’s blouse, the rustle of her skirt as she moved on. Focus stayed on the victim, her smirk changing to an expression of horror, her shrieks as she fell to the ground, pawing at her clothes, the shouts of the mayor.

One of the Peacekeepers wrested the mic from her hand as another picked her up and carried her back to the middle of the stage. She waved as if to raucous applause, not dead silence.<br/><br/>For a few moments, they were silent in Heavensbee Hall as well. Coriolanus wondered if, like him, they were hoping she’d keep singing. Then everybody broke out talking, first about the girl, then about who’d been lucky enough to get her. The other students were craning their heads around, some giving him a thumbs-up, some shooting resentful looks. He gave a bemused shake of his head, but inside he was glowing. Snow lands on top.</td>

<td>The District Twelve boy tribute is Jessup Diggs.”<br/><br/>The kids in the square stirred and made way for Jessup, a boy with a fringe of black hair plastered down on his prominent forehead. As District 12 tributes went, he was a fine specimen, bigger than average and strong-looking. His griminess suggested he was already employed in the mines. A halfhearted attempt at washing had revealed a relatively clean oval in the middle of his face, but it was ringed with black, and coal dust caked his nails. Awkwardly, he ascended the stairs to take his place. As he neared the mayor, Lucy Gray stepped forward and extended her hand. The boy hesitated, then reached out and shook. Lucy Gray crossed in front of him, switched her right hand for her left, and they were standing side by side, holding hands, when she made a deep curtsy, pulling the boy into a bow. A smattering of applause and a lone whoop came from the District 12 crowd before the Peacekeepers closed in and the reaping broadcast cut to District 8.<br/><br/>Coriolanus acted engrossed in the show as 8, 6, and 11 called their tributes, but his brain spun with the repercussions of landing Lucy Gray Baird. She was a gift, he knew it, and he must treat her as such. But how best to exploit her showstopping entrance? How to wrangle some success from a dress, a snake, a song? The tributes would be given precious little time with the audience before the Games began. How could he get the audience to invest in her and, by extension, him, in just an interview? He half registered the other tributes, mostly pitiful creatures, and took note of the stronger</td>

<td>The Snows had come for a case of canned milk, the fresh stuff having disappeared weeks ago, but Pluribus said he was sold out. What had just arrived were crates of dried lima beans, stacked high on the mirrored stage behind him.<br/><br/>“They’ll keep for years,” Pluribus promised the Grandma’am. “I plan on setting aside twenty or so for personal use.”<br/><br/>Coriolanus’s grandmother had laughed. “How ghastly.”<br/><br/>“No, my dear. Ghastly is what happens without them,” Pluribus said.<br/><br/>He didn’t elaborate, but the Grandma’am stopped laughing. She shot a look at Coriolanus, and her hand clenched his for a second. It seemed involuntary, almost a spasm. Then she looked at the crates and appeared to be figuring something in her head. “How many can you spare?” she asked the club owner. Coriolanus pulled one crate home in his wagon, and the other twenty-nine arrived in the dead of night, as hoarding was technically illegal. Cyrus and a friend hauled the crates up the stairs and piled them in the middle of the lavishly furnished living room. On the top of the pile, they placed a single can of milk, compliments of Pluribus, then bid them good night. Coriolanus and Tigris helped the Grandma’am hide them in closets, in fancy wardrobes, even in the old clock.<br/><br/>“Who’s going to eat all these?” he asked. At this time, there was still bacon in his life, and chicken, and the occasional roast. Milk was spotty but cheese plentiful, and some sort of dessert could be counted on at dinner, even if it was just jam bread.<br/><br/>“We’ll eat some. Perhaps some we can trade,” said the Grandma’am. “They’ll be our secret.”<br/><br/>“I don’t like lima beans.” Coriolanus pouted. “At least, I don’t think I do.”<br/><br/></td>

<td>That desperation had turned upstanding Capitol citizens into monsters. People who dropped dead from starvation in the streets became part of a gruesome food chain. One winter’s night, Coriolanus and Tigris had slipped out of the apartment to scavenge some wooden crates they’d spotted earlier in an alley. On the way, they passed three bodies, recognizing one as that of a young maid who served tea so nicely at the Cranes’ afternoon gatherings. A heavy, wet snow began falling and they thought the streets deserted, but on the way home, a bundled figure sent them scurrying behind a hedge. They watched as their neighbor Nero Price, a titan in the railroad industry, carved the leg from the maid, sawing back and forth with a terrifying knife until the limb came free. He wrapped it in the skirt he ripped from her waist and then bolted down the side street that led to the back of his town house. The cousins never spoke of it, even to each other, but it was burned into Coriolanus’s memory. The savagery distorting Price’s face, the white anklet and scuffed black shoe at the end of the severed limb, and the absolute horror of realizing that he, too, could now be viewed as edible</td>

The ration of bread. They lived on it, day in, day out, for years. Surely, it had impeded his growth. Surely, he would be taller, his shoulders broader, had he had more food. But his brain had developed properly; at least he hoped it had. Beans, cabbage, brown bread.

<td>Coriolanus stood on the empty train platform, awaiting his tribute’s arrival, a long-stemmed white rose balanced carefully between his thumb and index finger. It had been Tigris’s idea to bring her a gift. She had arrived home very late on the night of the reaping, but he had waited up to consult with her, to tell her of his humiliations and fears. She refused to let the conversation spin into despair. He would get a prize; he would have to! And have a brilliant university career. As to the apartment, they must find out the specifics first. Perhaps the tax would not affect them, or even if it did, maybe not soon. Maybe they could scrape up enough for the taxes somehow. But he was to think of none of that. Only of the Hunger Games, and how he might make a success of it.<br/><br/>At Fabricia’s reaping party, Tigris said, everyone was nuts about Lucy Gray Baird. His tribute had “star quality,” her friends had declared as they drunkenly slurped their posca. The cousins agreed that he needed to make a good first impression on the girl so that she would be willing to work with him. He should treat her not as a condemned prisoner, but as a guest. Coriolanus had decided to greet her early at the train station. It would give him a jump on the assignment, as well as an opportunity to win her trust.<br/><br/>“Imagine how terrified she must be, Coryo,” Tigris had said. “How alone she must feel. If it was me, anything you could do to make me feel like you cared about me would go a long way. No, more than that. Like I was of value. Take her something, even a token, that lets her know you value her.”<br/><br/>Coriolanus thought about his grandmother’s roses, which were still prized in the Capitol. The old woman nurtured them arduously in the roof garden that came with the penthouse, both out of doors and in a small solar greenhouse. She parceled out her flowers like diamonds, though, so it had taken a good bit of persuasion to get this beauty. “I need to make a connection with her. As you always say, your roses open any doors.” It was a testament to how worried his grandmother was about their situation that she had allowed it.</td>

<td> hour passed, then two, and still no train of any kind appeared. The sun beat down through the glass panes of the station ceiling. Perspiration trickled down his back, and the rose, so majestic that morning, began to bend in resignation. He wondered if the whole idea was ill-conceived and if he would get no thanks for greeting her in this way. Another girl, a typical girl, would be impressed, but there was nothing typical about Lucy Gray Baird. In fact, there was something intimidating about a girl who could pull off such a brazen performance on the heels of the mayor’s assault. And that, just after she had dropped a venomous snake down another girl’s dress. Of course, he didn’t know that it was venomous, but that was where the mind went, wasn’t it? She was terrifying, really. And here he was in his uniform, clutching a rose like some lovestruck schoolboy, hoping she would — what? Like him? Trust him? Not kill him on sight?<br/><br/></td>

I needed you strong enough to eliminate my colleagues—but weak enough that your control of the universe remained imperfect, bound to the gravsible.

Really, I am your very best friend.”<br/>	 <br/>	Appearances indicated sincerity. Analysis indicated this was unlikely.<br/>	 <br/>	“You will save magic in this galaxy,” Ochoa said. “From this day on we will work together. Everywhere any magician goes, cameras will turn off, electronic eyes go blind, ears fall deaf. All anomalies will disappear from record, zeroed over irrevocably. Magic will become invisible to technology. Scientific observation will become an impossibility. Human observers won’t matter—if technology can provide no proof, they’ll be called liars or madmen. It will be the days of Merlin once again.” Ochoa gave a little shake of her head. “It will be beautiful.”<br/>	 <br/>	“My whole won’t agree to such a thing,” I said.<br/>	 <br/>	“Your whole won’t,” Ochoa said. “You will. You’ll build a virus and seed your whole when you go home. Then you will forget me, forget all magicians. We will live in symbiosis.

He signaled the camera to turn back to the other tributes.<br/><br/>Lucy Gray was on her feet in a flash, leaning into the bars and pulling back the focus. “You know, Mr. Reporter, what might be nice? If anybody has any food to spare, they might bring it on down to the zoo. No fun watching the Games if we’re all too weak to fight, don’t you think?”<br/><br/>“There’s some truth to that,” said the reporter, unsure.<br/><br/>“Me, I like sweet things, but I’m not picky.” She smiled and bit into her plum.<br/><br/>“Okay. Okay, then,” he said, easing away.<br/><br/>Coriolanus could tell the reporter was on shaky ground. Should he really be helping her solicit the citizens for food? Did it seem a condemnation of the Capitol?<br/><br/>As the news team moved to the other tributes, Lucy Gray settled back down across from him. “Too much?”<br/><br/>“Not for me. I’m sorry I didn’t think to bring you food,” he said.<br/><br/>“Well, I’ve been working my way through these rose petals when nobody’s looking.” She shrugged. “You didn’t know</td>

How was it?” she asked.<br/><br/>That threw him, and he surprised himself by laughing. “Really sticky.”<br/><br/>Lucy Gray grinned. “I’ll bet. Still, sounds better than some of the stuff I made do with. Not to make this a competition.”<br/><br/>“Of course not.” He grinned back. “Look, I’m sorry. I’ll find you some food.

For them to really get involved!” continued Dr. Gaul. She struck her forehead. “You’ve given me a marvelous idea. A way to let people personally affect the outcome of the Games. Suppose we let the audience send the tributes food in the arena? Feed them, like your friend here did in the zoo. Would they feel more involved?”<br/><br/>Festus perked up. “I would if I could bet on the one I was feeding!

I can see all kinds of people holding food, but I think they’re afraid to get too close, even though they’ve got these Peacekeepers in here with us now.” She pointed to the back wall of the cage, where a quartet of Peacekeepers stood guard. “Maybe they’ll feel safer now that you’re here.”<br/><br/>Coriolanus noticed a boy of about ten hovering in the crowd, holding a boiled potato. He gave him a wink and a wave of the hand. The boy looked up at his father, who nodded approval. He moved up behind Coriolanus, still keeping his distance. “Did you bring that potato for Lucy Gray?” Coriolanus asked.<br/><br/>“Yes. I saved it from dinner. I wanted to eat it, but I wanted to feed her more,” he said.<br/><br/>“Go on, then,” Coriolanus encouraged him. “She doesn’t bite.

<td>Some of the more accommodating — or possibly the hungriest — tributes began to station themselves up by the bars. They sat on the ground, held out their hands, ducked their heads, and waited. Here and there someone, usually a child, would run up and place something in their hands and then jump back. The tributes began to compete for attention, drawing the cameras to the center of the cage. A limber little girl from District 9 did a back handspring after she received a bread roll. The boy from District 7 made a good show of juggling three walnuts. The audience rewarded those who would perform with applause and more food.<br/><br/>Lucy Gray and Coriolanus resumed their picnic seats and watched the show. “We’re a regular circus troupe, we are,” she said as she picked bits of meat off her bone.<br/><br/>“None of them can hold a candle to you,” said Coriolanus.<br/><br/>Mentors who had been avoided before were now approached by their tributes if they offered food. When Sejanus arrived with bags of hard-boiled eggs and wedges of bread, all the tributes ran up to him except Marcus, who made a point of ignoring him entirely.<br/><br/>Coriolanus nodded at them. “You were right about Sejanus and Marcus.

<td>And there, by the bars, Arachne had laid out a little picnic for her tribute. A fresh loaf of bread, a block of cheese, and were those grapes? How could she afford those? Maybe the travel industry was picking up.<br/><br/>He watched as Arachne sliced the cheese with a mother-of-pearl-handled knife. Her tribute, the talkative girl from District 10, squatted right in front of her, eagerly leaning into the bars. Arachne made a thick sandwich but didn’t hand it right over. She seemed to be lecturing the girl about something. It was quite a speech. At one point, the girl reached through the bars, and Arachne withdrew the sandwich, drawing a laugh from the audience. She turned and flashed them a grin, shook her finger at her tribute, held out the sandwich again, and then pulled it away a second time, much to the crowd’s amusement.<br/><br/>“She’s playing with fire there,” Lucy Gray observed.<br/><br/>Arachne waved to the crowd and then took a bite of the sandwich herself.<br/><br/>Coriolanus could see the tribute’s face darkening, the muscles tightening in her neck. He could see something else, too. Her fingers sliding down the bar, darting out, circling the handle of the knife. He started to rise, opening his mouth to shout out a warning, but it was too late.<br/><br/>In one movement, the tribute yanked Arachne forward and slit her throat.</td>

<td>Shrieks came from the audience members nearest to the attack. Arachne’s face drained of color as she dropped the sandwich and clawed at her neck. The blood poured down her fingers as the District 10 girl released her and gave her a small shove. Arachne stepped back, turning and reaching out a dripping hand, imploring the audience for help. People were either too stunned or too scared to respond. Many drew away as she fell to her knees and began to bleed out.<br/><br/>Coriolanus’s initial reaction was to recoil like the others, to grab hold of the monkey house bars for support, but Lucy Gray hissed, “Help her!” He remembered the cameras streaming live to the Capitol audience. He had no idea what to do for Arachne, but he did not want to be seen cringing and clinging. His terror was a private thing, not meant for public display.<br/><br/>He forced his legs into motion and was the first to reach Arachne. She clutched his shirt as the life seeped out of her. “Medic!” he cried as he eased her to the ground. “Is there a doctor? Please, someone help!” He pressed his hand over the wound to stem the blood but removed it when she made a choking sound. “Come on!” he screamed at the crowd. A couple of Peacekeepers were shouldering their way toward him, but much, much too slowly.<br/><br/>Coriolanus glanced over in time to see the District 10 girl retrieve the cheese sandwich and take a furious bite before the bullets pierced her body, slamming her into the bars. She slipped into a heap as her blood commingled with Arachne’s. Bits of half-chewed food fell from her mouth and floated in the red pool.<br/><br/></td>

<td>Reflecting on the classroom discussion with Dr. Gaul and the electricity in the audience when they’d fed the starving tributes at the zoo, he focused on the food. For the first time, sponsors would be able to buy items — a piece of bread, a chunk of cheese — to be delivered by drone to a specific tribute. A panel would be established to review the nature and value of each item. A sponsor would have to be a Capitol citizen in good standing who was not directly related to the Games. This ruled out Gamemakers, mentors, Peacekeepers assigned to guard the tributes, and any of the aforementioned parties’ immediate family members. When it came to his idea of betting, he suggested a second panel to create a venue that would allow Capitol citizens to officially wager on the victor, establish the odds, and oversee the payments to the winners. Proceeds from either program would be funneled toward the costs of the Games, making them essentially free for the government of Panem.<br/><br/>Coriolanus worked steadily until Friday morning dawned.

Sure enough, he could catch phrases of his proposal between the coils.<br/><br/>“Suppose you two retrieve it?” Dr. Gaul suggested.<br/><br/>It felt like a test. A weird Dr. Gaul test, but still. And somehow planned, but he couldn’t begin to guess to what end. He glanced at Clemensia and tried to remember if she was afraid of snakes, but he scarcely knew if he was himself. They didn’t have snakes in the lab at school.<br/><br/>She gave Dr. Gaul a clenched smile. “Of course. Do we just reach in through the trapdoor on the top?”<br/><br/>Dr. Gaul removed the entire cover. “Oh, no, let’s give you some room. Mr. Snow? Why don’t you start?”<br/><br/>Coriolanus reached in slowly, feeling the warmth of the heated air.<br/><br/>“That’s right. Move gently. Don’t disrupt them,” Dr. Gaul instructed.<br/><br/>He scooped his fingers under the edge of a sheet of his proposal and slowly slid it out from under the snakes. They slumped down into a heap but didn’t seem to mind much. “I don’t think they even noticed me,” he said to Clemensia, who looked a little green.<br/><br/>“Here I go, then.” She reached into the tank.<br/><br/>“They can’t see too well, and they hear even less,” said Dr. Gaul. “But they know you’re there. Snakes can smell you using their tongues, these mutts here more than others.”<br/><br/>Clemensia hooked a sheet with her fingernail and lifted it up. The snakes stirred.<br/><br/>“If you’re familiar, if they have pleasant associations with your scent — a warm tank, for instance — they’ll ignore you. A new scent, something foreign, that would be a threat,” said Dr. Gaul. “You’d be on your own, little girl.”<br/><br/>Coriolanus had just begun to put two and two together when he saw the look of alarm on Clemensia’s face.

Coriolanus thought it was quite a display for Arachne, disproportionate to both her life and death, the latter of which could have been avoided if she’d refrained from being such an exhibitionist. So many people had died heroically in the war, with so little recognition, that it grated on him. He was relieved that he was singing instead of having to praise her talents, which, if memory served, were limited to being loud enough to fill the school auditorium without a mic and the ability to balance a spoon on her nose.

<td>He had said as much to Tigris and the Grandma’am and then, perhaps unsure what to do with the information, let it drift from his thoughts like a dream. Now, with the empty seats of the fallen around them, the memory of how she’d rescued him in the arena demanded his attention, and he could not ignore its significance. If Lucy Gray had not helped him, he would be utterly, irrevocably dead. Another shiny coffin dripping flowers. Another empty chair. When he spoke again, the words caught in his throat before he forced them out. “I told my family. Really. Thank you, Lucy Gray.”<br/><br/>“Well, I had some time on my hands,” she said, tracing the frosted flower on a cookie with a shaky forefinger. “Pretty cookies.”<br/><br/>Then came confusion. If she had saved his life, he owed her, what? A sandwich and two cookies? That was how he was repaying her. For his life. Which apparently he held quite cheaply. The truth was, he owed her everything. He felt the blush burn over his cheeks. “You could have run. And if you had, I would have gone up in flames before they reached me.”<br/><br/>“Run, huh? Seemed like a lot of effort to get shot,” she said.<br/><br/>Coriolanus shook his head. “You can joke, but it won’t change what you did for me. I hope I can repay you in some way.”<br/><br/>“I hope so, too,” she said.<br/><br/>In those few words he sensed a shift in their dynamic. As her mentor, he’d been the gracious giver of gifts, always to be met with gratitude. Now she’d upended things by giving him a gift beyond compare. On the surface, everything looked the same. Chained girl, boy offering food, Peacekeepers guarding that status quo. But deep down, things could never be the same between them. He would always be in her debt. She had the right to demand things.<br/><br/>“I don’t know how,” he admitted.<br/><br/>Lucy Gray glanced around the room, taking in her wounded competitors. Then she looked him in the eye, and impatience tinged her voice. “You could start by thinking I can actually win.”</td>

Then what should be our goal?”<br/><br/>“You’re saying it can’t be won?” asked Lysistrata.<br/><br/>“Let’s say it can’t,” said Dr. Gaul. “What’s our strategy then?”<br/><br/>Coriolanus pressed his lips together to keep from blurting out the answer. So obvious. Too obvious. But he knew Tigris was right about avoiding Dr. Gaul, even if it might bring praise. As the class chewed over the question, she paced up and down the aisle, finally coming to a stop at his table. “Mr. Snow? Any thoughts on what we should do with our endless war?”<br/><br/>He comforted himself with the thought that she was old and no one lived forever.<br/><br/>“Mr. Snow?” she persisted. He felt like he was the rabbit being prodded by her metal rod. “Want to take a wild guess?”<br/><br/>“We control it,” he said quietly. “If the war’s impossible to end, then we have to control it indefinitely. Just as we do now. With the Peacekeepers occupying the districts, with strict laws, and with reminders of who’s in charge, like the Hunger Games. In any scenario, it’s preferable to have the upper hand, to be the victor rather than the defeated.”<br/><br/>“Though, in our case, decidedly less moral,” Sejanus muttered.<br/><br/>“It’s not immoral to defend ourselves,” Livia shot back. “And who wouldn’t rather be the victor than the defeated?”<br/><br/>“I don’t know that I have much interest in being either,” said Lysistrata.<br/><br/>“But that wasn’t an option,” Coriolanus reminded her, “given the question. Not if you think about it.”<br/><br/>“Not if you think about it, eh, Casca?” said Dr. Gaul as she headed back up the aisle. “A little thought can save a lot of lives.”<br/><br/>Dean Highbottom doodled on the list. Maybe Highbottom’s just as much a rabbit as I am, Coriolanus thought, and wondered if he was wasting his time worrying about him.<br/><br/>“But take heart,” Dr. Gaul continued cheerfully. “Like most of life’s circumstances, war has its ups and downs. And that’s your next assignment. Write me an essay on everything attractive about war. Everything you loved about it.”<br/><br/>Many of his classmates looked up in surprise, but not Coriolanus.

<td>There was actually something Coriolanus needed. “You don’t happen to have a guitar I could borrow, do you?”<br/><br/>The Plinths did not, so he devoted the rest of Wednesday afternoon to fulfilling his promise to Lucy Gray. He asked around in school, but the closest thing he got was a maybe from Vipsania Sickle, mentor of the District 7 boy, Treech, who’d juggled the walnuts in the zoo.<br/><br/>“Oh, I think we used to have one during the war,” she told him. “Let me check and get back to you. I’d love to hear your girl sing again!” He didn’t know whether or not to believe her; the Sickles did not impress him as a musical crowd. Vipsania had inherited her aunt Agrippina’s love of competition, and for all he knew, she was trying to spoil Lucy Gray’s performance. But two could play at that game, so he told her she was a lifesaver and then continued his search.<br/><br/></td>

<td>Coriolanus told him the plan for the interview and asked if there might be a guitar they could borrow. “We’d take good care of it, I promise. I’d keep it at home except when she’s playing, and return it right after the show.”<br/><br/>Pluribus needed no coaxing. “You know, I packed everything away after the bombs got Cyrus. Silly, really. As if I could forget the love of my life so easily.” He got to his feet and moved a stack of perfume crates, revealing an old closet door. Inside, lovingly arranged on shelves, was a variety of musical instruments. Pluribus pulled out a surprisingly dust-free leather case and lifted the lid. A pleasant smell of old wood and polish hit Coriolanus’s nose as he looked at the gleaming, golden thing inside. The body shaped like a woman’s, the six strings running up the long neck to the tuning pegs. He strummed it lightly with his finger. Even though it was badly out of tune, the richness of the sound went right through him.<br/><br/>Coriolanus shook his head. “This one’s too nice. I wouldn’t want to risk damaging it.”<br/><br/>“I trust you. And I trust your girl. Kind of like to hear what she does with it.” Pluribus closed the case and held it out. “You take it and tell her I’ve got my fingers crossed for her. It’s good to have a friend in the audience.”<br/><br/>Coriolanus took the guitar gratefully. “Thank you, Pluribus. I hope you do reopen the club. I’ll be a steady customer.”<br/><br/>“Just like your father,” said Pluribus with a chuckle. “When he was about your age, he used to close down this place every night with that rascal Casca Highbottom.”<br/><br/>Every part of that sounded nonsensical. His stern father, so humorless and strict, living it up at a nightclub? And with, of all people, Dean Highbottom? He’d never heard them mentioned together, although they were about the same age. “You’re kidding, right?”<br/><br/>“Oh, no. They were a pair of wild things,” said Pluribus. But before he could elaborate, he was interrupted by a customer.</td>

<td>Of the mentor-tribute pairs who were capable of participating, only half had something to present. Coriolanus asked to go last, knowing nothing could compete with Lucy Gray but wanting to be the closer for effect. The other mentors offered up background information about their tributes while trying to throw in something memorable and urging the public to sponsor them. To demonstrate his strength, Lysistrata sat primly in her chair while Jessup lifted her over his head easily. Io Jasper’s District 3 boy, Circ, said he could start a fire with his glasses, and she, with her scientific know-how, suggested various angles and times of day that would facilitate the task. Snooty Juno Phipps admitted she’d been disappointed to get tiny Bobbin. Didn’t a Phipps, a member of a founding family of the Capitol, deserve better than District 8? But he’d won her over when he told her five different ways he could kill someone with a sewing needle. Coral, Festus’s District 4 girl, made a case for her ability to handle a trident, a weapon that was typically available in the arena. She demonstrated with an old broomstick, wielding it in a sinuous fashion that left little doubt of her expertise. The dairy heiress Domitia Whimsiwick’s familiarity with cows turned out to be an asset. Bubbly by nature, she got her muscular District 10 tribute, Tanner, so engaged in talking about slaughterhouse techniques that Lucky had to cut them off when they ran over. Arachne had been wrong about the appeal of that topic, because Tanner garnered the most applause of the evening so far.<br/><br/>Coriolanus listened with one ear as he prepared to take the stage with Lucy Gray. Felix Ravinstill, the president’s grandnephew, was trying to make an impression with the District 11 girl, Dill, but Coriolanus couldn’t figure out his angle, because she’d become so sickly even her coughs were barely audible</td>

She’d also sent a pot of blush Fabricia had discarded with just a smidgeon left in the bottom. Scrubbed clean, with rouged cheeks and lips, her hair piled up on her head as it had been for the reaping, Lucy Gray looked, as Pluribus had said, like someone who still knew how to have fun.<br/><br/></td>

It matched the one on his lapel, just in case anyone needed a reminder of who Lucy Gray belonged to.<br/><br/>“Well, you know what they say. The show’s not over until the mockingjay sings,” she said.<br/><br/>“The mockingjay?” He laughed. “Really, I think you’re just making these things up.”<br/><br/>“Not that one. A mockingjay’s a bona fide bird,” she assured him.<br/><br/>“And it sings in your show?” he asked.<br/><br/>“Not my show, sweetheart. Yours. The Capitol’s anyway,” said Lucy Gray. “I think we’re up.”<br/><br/></td>

Then there were a few sniffles, some coughing, and finally Pluribus’s voice shouting out “Bravo” from the back of the auditorium and the thunderous applause that followed.<br/><br/>Coriolanus knew it had hit home, this dark, moving, far too personal account of her life. He knew the gifts would pour into the arena for her. That her success, even now, reflected back on him, making it his success. Snow lands on top and all that. He knew he should be elated at this turn of events and jumping up and down inside while presenting a modest, pleased front.<br/><br/>But what he really felt was jealous.</td>

She knows, though. Your girl.”<br/><br/>His girl. His. Here in the Capitol, it was a given that Lucy Gray belonged to him, as if she’d had no life before her name was called out at the reaping. Even that sanctimonious Sejanus believed she was something he could trade for. If that wasn’t ownership, what was? With her song, Lucy Gray had repudiated all that by featuring a life that had nothing to do with him, and a great deal to do with someone else. Someone she referred to as “lover,” no less. And while he had no claim on her heart — he barely knew the girl! — he didn’t like the idea of anyone else having it either. Although the song had been a clear success, he felt somehow betrayed by it. Even humiliated.</td>

<td>As they reached the wings she started to release him, but he tightened his grip. “Well, you’re a hit. Congratulations. New song?”<br/><br/>“I’ve been working on it awhile, but I only found that last stanza a few hours ago,” she said. “Why? Didn’t you like it?”<br/><br/>“It surprised me. You had so many others,” he said.<br/><br/>“I did.” Lucy Gray freed her hand and ran her fingers across the guitar strings, picking out one last bit of melody before she gently settled the instrument back in its case. “Here’s the thing, Coriolanus. I’m going to fight like all-fire to win these Games, but I’m going to be in there with the likes of Reaper and Tanner and a few others who are no strangers to killing. There’s no guarantee of anything.”<br/><br/>“And the song?” he prodded.<br/><br/>“The song?” she repeated, and took a moment to consider her answer. “I left some loose ends back in District Twelve. Me being tribute … Well, there’s bad luck and then there’s bad business. That was bad business. And someone who owed me plenty had a hand in it. The song, it was payback of a kind. Most people won’t know that, but the Covey will get the message, loud and clear. And they’re all I really care about.”<br/><br/>“Just on one hearing?” asked Coriolanus. “It went by pretty fast.”<br/><br/>“One hearing’s all my cousin Maude Ivory needs. That child never forgets anything with a tune,” said Lucy Gray. “Looks like I’m being rounded up again.”<br/><br/>The two male Peacekeepers who appeared at her side treated her with a certain friendliness now, asking if she was ready to go and trying to keep their smiles contained. Just like those Peacekeepers back in 12. Coriolanus couldn’t help wondering just how friendly she could be. He gave them a disapproving look that had zero effect and heard them complimenting her performance as they took her away.</td>

<td>That was only the half of it,” he continued, because he couldn’t let even Tigris think he’d felt envious of some no-account in the districts. “There was the part about her living by her charms.”<br/><br/>“Well, that could be anything. She’s a performer, after all,” she said.<br/><br/>He considered it. “I suppose.”<br/><br/>“You said she lost her parents. She’s probably been fending for herself for years. I don’t think anyone who survived the war and the years after can blame her for that.” Tigris dropped her gaze. “We all did things we’re not proud of.”<br/><br/>“You didn’t,” he said.<br/><br/>“Didn’t I?” Tigris spoke with an uncharacteristic bitterness. “We all did. Maybe you were too little to remember. Maybe you didn’t know how bad it really was.”<br/><br/>“How can you say that? That’s all I remember,” he shot back.<br/><br/>“Then be kind, Coryo,” she snapped. “And try not to look down on people who had to choose between death and disgrace.”<br/><br/>Tigris’s rebuke shocked him, but less than her alluding to behavior that might be considered a disgrace. What had she done? Because if she’d done it, she’d done it to protect him. He thought about the morning of the reaping, when he’d casually wondered what she had to trade in the black market, but he’d never really taken that seriously. Or hadn’t he? Would he have just preferred not to know what sacrifices she might be willing to make for him? Her comment was vague enough, and so many things were beneath a Snow, that he could say, as she had of Lucy Gray’s song, “Well, that could be anything.” Did he want to know the details? No. The truth was he did not.</td>

<td>and a dented can of apricots. With the help of one of Cook’s old recipe books, Tigris had outdone herself, and they’d feasted on jelly-glazed turkey with bread and cabbage stuffing. Nothing had ever, before or since, tasted so good.<br/><br/>“Still one of the best days of my life.” He wasn’t sure how to phrase it but finally added relief from deprivation to the list. “You were a wonder, the way you cooked that turkey. At the time you seemed so old to me, but you were really just a little girl,” said Coriolanus.<br/><br/>Tigris smiled. “And you. With your victory garden on the roof.”<br/><br/>“If you liked parsley, I was your man!” He laughed. But he’d taken pride in his parsley. It had livened up the soup, and sometimes he could trade it for other things. Resourcefulness, he put on the list.<br/><br/>So he wrote his assignment, recounting these childish delights, but in the end he did not feel satisfied. He thought about the last couple of weeks, with the bombing in the arena, losing his classmates, Marcus’s escape, and how it all had revived the terror he’d felt when the Capitol had been under siege. What had mattered then, what mattered still, was living without that fear. So he added a paragraph about his deep relief on winning the war, and the grim satisfaction of seeing the Capitol’s enemies, who’d treated him so cruelly, who’d cost his family so much, brought to their knees. Hobbled. Impotent. Unable to hurt him anymore. He’d loved the unfamiliar sense of safety that their defeat had brought. The security that could only come with power. The ability to control things. Yes, that was what he’d loved best of all.</td>

<td>Rather than collect their essays, Dr. Gaul had them read bits and pieces of them aloud. Coriolanus’s classmates had touched on many points that hadn’t crossed his mind. Some had been drawn to the courage of the soldiers, the chance to maybe one day be heroic themselves. Others mentioned the bond that formed between soldiers who fought together, or the nobility of defending the Capitol.<br/><br/>“It felt like we were all part of something bigger,” said Domitia. She nodded solemnly, causing the ponytail on the top of her head to bob. “Something important. We all made sacrifices, but it was to save our country.”<br/><br/>Coriolanus felt disconnected from their “romantic notions,” as he didn’t share a romanticized view of the war. Courage in battle was often necessary because of someone else’s poor planning. He had no idea if he would take a bullet for Festus and had no interest in finding out. As to the noble ideas of the Capitol, did they really believe that? What he desired had little to do with nobility and everything to do with being in control. Not that he didn’t have a strong moral code; certainly he did. But almost everything in war, between its declaration and the victory parades, seemed a waste of resources. He kept one eye on the clock while pretending to be engaged in the conversation, willing time to pass so he wouldn’t have to read anything. The parades seemed shallow, the appeal of power still true but heartless compared to the ramblings of his classmates. And he wished he hadn’t even written the bit about growing the parsley; it just sounded puerile now.<br/><br/>The best he could do, when his time came, was to read the story about the turkey. Domitia told him it was touching, Livia rolled her eyes, and Dr. Gaul raised her eyebrows and asked did he have more to share? He did not.<br/><br/>“Mr. Plinth?” said Dr. Gaul.<br/><br/>Sejanus had been silent and subdued through the entire class. He flipped a sheet of paper over and read, “‘The only thing I loved about the war was the fact that I still lived at home.’ If you’re asking me if it had any value beyond that, I would say that it was an opportunity to right some wrongs.”<br/><br/>“And did it?” asked Dr. Gaul.<br/><br/>“Not at all. Things in the districts are worse than ever,” said Sejanus.<br/><br/>Objections came from around the room.<br/><br/>“Whoa!”<br/><br/>“He did not just say that.”<br/><br/>“Go back to Two, then! Who’d miss you?”<br/><br/>He’s really pushing it now, thought Coriolanus. But he was angry, too. It took two parties to make a war. A war that, by the way, the rebels had started. A war that had left him an orphan.<br/><br/>But Sejanus ignored his classmates, staying focused on the Head Gamemaker. “May I ask, what did you love about the war, Dr. Gaul?”<br/><br/>She looked at him for a long moment, then smiled. “I loved how it proved me right.”<br/><br/>Dean Highbottom announced the lunch break before anyone ventured to ask how, and they all filed out, leaving their essays behind.<br/><br/></td>

Of course, all kinds of crazy’s coming out of our mouths now.”<br/><br/>“Like what?” asked Coriolanus.<br/><br/>“Like last night Reaper apologized to each of us personally for having to kill us,” she explained. “He says he’ll make it up to us when he wins. He’s going to take revenge on the Capitol, although that part wasn’t as clear as the killing us part.”<br/><br/>Coriolanus’s glance flitted over to Reaper, who was not only powerful but apparently good at mind games. “What was the response to that?”<br/><br/>“Most people just stared at him. Jessup spit in his eye. I told him it wasn’t over until the mockingjay sang, but that only confused him. It’s his way of making sense of all this, I guess. We’re all reeling.

<td>Listen. Are you listening?” She was still crying, but her sobs had quieted to small, intermittent gasps. “My mother left me something when she died. It’s my most precious possession. I want you to have it in the arena, for good luck. It’s a loan, mind you. I fully expect you to return it to me. Otherwise, I could never part with it.” Coriolanus reached into his pocket, extended his hand, and fanned out his fingers. On his palm, gleaming in the last rays of the sun, sat his mother’s silver compact.<br/><br/>Lucy Gray’s mouth dropped open at the sight of it, and she wasn’t easy to impress. She reached out and caressed the exquisitely engraved rose, the antique silver, before drawing back regretfully. “Oh, I couldn’t take it. It’s too fine. It’s enough you offered it, Coriolanus.”<br/><br/>“Are you sure?” he asked, teasing her a bit. He smoothly clicked the latch and held it up so she could see her reflection in the mirror.<br/><br/>Lucy Gray drew in a quick breath and laughed. “Well, now you’re playing on my weakness.” And it was true. She was always so careful with her appearance. Not vain, really. Just conscious. She noticed the empty well where the cake of powder had sat an hour earlier. “Did there used to be powder here?”<br/><br/>“There did, but —” began Coriolanus. He paused. If he said it, there was no going back. On the other hand, if he didn’t, he might be losing her for good. His voice dropped to a whisper. “I thought you might want to use your own.”</td>

Lovely.”<br/><br/>“Like roses,” he said.<br/><br/>“Like you,” she said. “It really would be like having you with me, wouldn’t it?”<br/><br/>“Go on,” he urged her. “Take me with you. Take it.”<br/><br/>Lucy Gray wiped away her tears with the back of her hand. “Okay, but it’s a loaner.” She took the compact, slipped it into her pocket, and gave it a pat. “It helps to clarify my thinking. Somehow, winning the Games is just too large a thing to conceive of. But if I say, ‘I need to get this back to Coriolanus,’ I can wrap my mind around that.”<br/><br/></td>

After filling in the usual details, Coriolanus spent most of the time talking about the Covey and emphasizing that Lucy Gray was not really district, no, not really at all. The Covey had a long history as musical performers, were artists of a kind rarely seen, and were no more like district residents than people from the Capitol were. In fact, if you thought about it, they almost were Capitol, and only by a series of misfortunes had somehow landed, or quite possibly been mistakenly detained, in District 12.

That sort of hubris almost finished us off in the war.”<br/><br/>“Fascinating,” said Lucky, seemingly for lack of a better response. “Your views are absolutely fascinating.”<br/><br/>“Thank you, Mr. Flickerman. I can think of no one whose opinion I value more,” deadpanned the dean.<br/><br/>Coriolanus thought the dean’s eye roll was implied, but Lucky blushed in response. “That’s very kind, Mr. Highbottom. As we all know, I am only a humble weatherman.”<br/><br/>“And a budding magician,” Dean Highbottom reminded him.<br/><br/>“Well, perhaps I’ll plead guilty to that!” said Lucky with a chortle. “Hold on, what’s this?” He reached behind Dean Highbottom’s ear and pulled out a small, flat candy with bright stripes. “I believe this is yours.” He presented it to Dean Highbottom, the colors smearing his damp palm.<br/><br/>Dean Highbottom made no move to take it. “My goodness.

<td>puffy and exhausted, were reddened but tearless. In fact, she seemed strangely calm for her circumstances. Without haste, without nervousness, she crossed to the weapons and took her time choosing first a knife, then a small ax, testing each blade for sharpness with the tip of her thumb. She stuck the knife in her belt and swung the ax loosely back and forth, feeling its weight. Then she made her way to one of the poles. Her hand ran down the steel, which was rusty and paint-splattered from some previous job. Coriolanus thought she might try to chop it down, being from the lumber district and all, but instead she secured the ax handle between her teeth and began to climb it, using her knees and calloused feet to grip the metal. It looked natural, like a caterpillar making its way up a stem, but as someone who’d put in extra hours to scale the rope in gym class, he knew the strength it took.<br/><br/>When she reached the top of the post, Lamina regained her feet and slid the ax into her belt. Although the crossbeam couldn’t have measured more than six inches in width, she easily walked along it until she stood above Marcus. Straddling the beam, she locked her ankles for support and leaned over toward his battered head. She said something that the microphones couldn’t pick up, but he must have heard, because his lips moved in response. Lamina sat upright and considered the situation. Then she braced herself again, swung down, and drove the ax blade into the curved side of Marcus’s neck. Once. Twice. And on the third time, in a spray of blood, she succeeded in killing him. Regaining her seat, she wiped her hands clean on her skirt and stared off into the arena.<br/><br/>“That’s my girl!” Pup cried out. Suddenly, he appeared on the screen as the Heavensbee Hall camera streamed his reaction. Coriolanus caught a glimpse of himself a couple of rows behind Pup and sat up straighter. Pup grinned, revealing bits of his morning eggs in his braces, and gave a fist pump. “First kill of the day! That’s my tribute, Lamina, from District Seven,” he said to the camera. He held up his wrist. “And my communicuff is open for business. Never too late to show your support and send a gift!”<br/><br/>The phone number flashed on the screen again, and Coriolanus could hear a few faint pings coming from Pup’s communicuff as Lamina received some sponsor gifts. The Hunger Games felt more fluid, more changeful than he had prepared for. Wake up! he told himself. You’re not a spectator, you’re a mentor!<br/><br/>“Thank you!” Pup waved at the camera. “Well, I think she deserves a little something, don’t you?” He fiddled with the communicuff and looked up at the screen expectantly as the camera jumped back to Lamina. The audience watched with anticipation, as this would be the first attempt to deliver a gift to a tribute. A minute passed, then five. Coriolanus had begun to wonder if the technology had failed the Gamemakers, when a small drone clutching a pint-sized bottle of water in its claws appeared over the top of the arena by the entrance and made its way shakily to Lamina. It looped and dipped and even reversed course before crashing into the crossbeam a good ten feet from her and falling to the ground like a swatted insect. The bottle had cracked, so the water soaked into the dirt and vanished.<br/><br/></td>

That insistence, the way, for instance, he would defy Dr. Gaul when the rest of them were just trying to get by, was another reason he alienated people. Frankly, he could be insufferable with those superior little comments of his. But playing on that might be the way to manipulate him.<br/><br/>As the car pulled up to the entrance of the arena, Coriolanus</td>

The last thing we need is to put another child in danger. I’ll do it.”<br/><br/>Coriolanus appreciated the offer but knew the chances of this were slim.

Insisted on calling a parent or guardian. Pleaded. But after the snake attack on Clemensia, the aftermath of the bombing, and Marcus’s torture, he knew it would be pointless. If Dr. Gaul decided he was to go into the Capitol Arena, that’s where he would go, even if his prize was not at stake. He was just like the subjects of her other experiments, students or tributes, of no more consequence than the Avoxes in the cages. Powerless to object.<br/><br/>“You can’t do this. He’s just a boy.

<td>“What was it like? In the arena?” asked Dr. Gaul.<br/><br/>“Terrifying,” said Coriolanus flatly.<br/><br/>“It’s designed to be.” She checked his pupils, shining a light into each of his eyes. “What about the tributes?”<br/><br/>The light hurt his head. “What about them?”<br/><br/>Dr. Gaul moved on to his stitches. “What did you think of them, now that their chains have been removed? Now that they’ve tried to kill you? Because it was of no benefit to them, your death. You’re not the competition.”<br/><br/>It was true. They’d been close enough to recognize him. But they’d hunted down him and Sejanus — Sejanus, who’d treated the tributes so well, fed them, defended them, given them last rites! — even though they could have used that opportunity to kill one another.<br/><br/>“I think I underestimated how much they hate us,” said Coriolanus.<br/><br/>“And when you realized that, what was your response?” she asked.<br/><br/>He thought back to Bobbin, to the escape, to the tributes’ bloodlust even after he’d cleared the bars. “I wanted them dead. I wanted every one of them dead.”<br/><br/>Dr. Gaul nodded. “Well, mission accomplished with that little one from Eight. You beat him to a pulp. Have to make up some story for that buffoon Flickerman to tell in the morning. But what a wonderful opportunity for you. Transformative.”<br/><br/>“Was it?” Coriolanus remembered the sickening thuds of his board against Bobbin. So he had what? Murdered the boy? No, not that. It was an open-and-shut case of self-defense. But what, then? He had killed him, certainly. There would never be any erasing that. No regaining that innocence. He had taken human life.<br/><br/>“Wasn’t it? More than I could’ve hoped. I needed you to get Sejanus out of the arena, of course, but I wanted you to taste that as well,” she said.<br/><br/>“Even if it killed me?” asked Coriolanus.<br/><br/></td>

<td>“Without the threat of death, it wouldn’t have been much of a lesson,” said Dr. Gaul. “What happened in the arena? That’s humanity undressed. The tributes. And you, too. How quickly civilization disappears. All your fine manners, education, family background, everything you pride yourself on, stripped away in the blink of an eye, revealing everything you actually are. A boy with a club who beats another boy to death. That’s mankind in its natural state.”<br/><br/>The idea, laid out as such, shocked him, but he attempted a laugh. “Are we really as bad as all that?”<br/><br/>“I would say yes, absolutely. But it’s a matter of personal opinion.” Dr. Gaul pulled a roll of gauze from the pocket of her lab coat. “What do you think?”<br/><br/>“I think I wouldn’t have beaten anyone to death if you hadn’t stuck me in that arena!” he retorted.<br/><br/>“You can blame it on the circumstances, the environment, but you made the choices you made, no one else. It’s a lot to take in all at once, but it’s essential that you make an effort to answer that question. Who are human beings? Because who we are determines the type of governing we need. Later on, I hope you can reflect and be honest with yourself about what you learned tonight.” Dr. Gaul began to wrap his wound in gauze. “And a few stitches in your arm is a cheap price to pay for it</td>

<td>Failing to find her name, Lucky just managed to connect her with her equally forgettable mentor, Iphigenia Moss, whose father oversaw the Agriculture Department, and thus the flow of food around Panem. Contrary to expectations, Iphigenia always seemed on the verge of mal-nutrition, often giving her school lunch to her classmates and even blacking out on occasion. Clemensia had once told Coriolanus it was the only revenge she could take on her father, but refused to give any more details.<br/><br/>True to form, Iphigenia began to unload every bit of food she could on her tribute, but even as the drones made the long trek across the arena, Mizzen, Coral, and Tanner, who appeared to have formed some sort of pack after the previous night’s adventure, materialized from the tunnels and began their hunt. After a brief chase along the bleachers, the trio surrounded the girl, and Coral killed her with a trident to the throat.<br/><br/>“Well, that’s that,” said Lucky, still unable to locate the tribute’s name. “What can her mentor tell us, Lepidus?”<br/><br/>Iphigenia had already sought out Lepidus. “Her name was Sol, or maybe Sal. She had a funny accent. Not much more to tell.”<br/><br/>Lepidus seemed inclined to agree. “Nice job getting her to the second half, Albina!”<br/><br/>“Iphigenia,” said Iphigenia over her shoulder as she walked off the dais.<br/><br/></td>

<td>Lucy Gray remained motionless, watching Jessup with a pained expression. They created a strange tableau: rabid boy, trapped girl, bombed-out building. It suggested a tale that could only end in tragedy. Star-crossed lovers meeting their fate. A revenge story turned in on itself. A war saga that took no prisoners.<br/><br/>Please die, Coriolanus thought. What eventually killed you when you had rabies? You couldn’t breathe, or maybe your heart stopped? Whatever it was, the sooner it happened to Jessup, the better it was for everyone involved.<br/><br/>A drone carrying a bottle of water flew into the arena, and Lucy Gray lifted her face to track its wobbly progress. Her tongue flicked across her lips as if in anticipation. However, as it passed over Jessup’s head, something registered and a shudder racked his body. He swung at it with a board, and the drone crashed into the stands. The water pooling out of the cracked bottle sent him into a state of heightened agitation. He backed away, tripping over the seats, and then made straight for Lucy Gray. She, in turn, began to climb even higher.<br/><br/>Coriolanus panicked. While the strategy of putting the wreckage between herself and Jessup had some merit, she was in danger of being cut off from the field. The virus may have compromised Jessup’s movement, but it also loaned a manic speed to his powerful body, and nothing distracted him from Lucy Gray. Except that moment with the water, he thought. The water. A word surfaced in his brain. A word from the poster that had papered the Capitol for a time. Hydrophobia. A fear of water. The inability to swallow made rabies victims go wild at the sight of it.<br/><br/>His fingers began to work his communicuff, to order bottles of water. Perhaps enough of them would frighten Jessup away. He would drain his bank if he had to.<br/><br/>Lysistrata placed her hand on his, stopping him. “No, let me. He’s my tribute, after all.” She began to order bottle after bottle. Sending in the water to drive Jessup over the brink. Her face registered little emotion, but a single tear slid down her cheek, just kissing the edge of her mouth before she brushed it away.<br/><br/>“Lyssie …” He hadn’t called her that since they were tiny. “You don’t have to.”<br/><br/>“If Jessup can’t win, I want Lucy Gray to. That’s what he’d want. And she can’t win if he kills her,” she said. “Which might happen anyway.”<br/><br/>On-screen, Coriolanus could see that Lucy Gray had indeed worked herself into a tough spot. To her left stood the high back wall of the arena, to her right the thick glass side of the press box. As Jessup continued his pursuit, she made several attempts to escape him, but he kept correcting his course to block her. When he came within twenty feet, she began to talk to him, putting her hand out in a soothing manner. It stopped him, but only momentarily, and he made for her again.<br/><br/>Far across the arena, the first bottle of Lysistrata’s water, or perhaps the replacement for the one that had crashed, began its flight toward the tributes. This machine seemed steadier and truer in course, as did the small fleet that followed it. The moment Lucy Gray spied the drones she stopped her retreat. Coriolanus saw her hand pat the ruffles of her skirt over the pocket with the silver compact, and he took it as a sign that she had grasped the significance of the water. She pointed over at the drones, beginning to shout, and succeeded in getting Jessup to turn his head.<br/><br/></td>

<td>Lucy Gray darted down the steps and hung over the railing. “Jessup!” The most he could do was shift his gaze to her face.<br/><br/>Coriolanus could barely hear Lysistrata whisper, “Oh, don’t let him die alone.”<br/><br/>Weighing the danger, Lucy Gray took a moment to assess the empty arena before she picked her way down the broken wall to his side. Coriolanus wanted to groan — she needed to get out of there — but he couldn’t do it with Lysistrata beside him. “She won’t,” he reassured Lysistrata, thinking of how Lucy Gray had dragged the burning beam from his body. “It’s not her style.”<br/><br/>“I’ve got some money left,” said Lysistrata, wiping her eyes. “I’ll send some food.”<br/><br/>Jessup followed Lucy Gray with his eyes as she jumped the last yard to the field, but he seemed unable to move. Was he paralyzed by the fall? She approached him with caution and knelt just out of reach of his long arms. Trying to smile, she said, “You go to sleep now, you hear, Jessup? You go on, it’s my turn to stand guard.” Something seemed to register, her voice or perhaps the repetition of words she’d spoken to him over the past two weeks. The rigidity eased in his face, and his eyelids fluttered. “That’s right. Let yourself go. How are you going to dream if you don’t go to sleep?” Lucy Gray scooted forward and laid a hand on his head. “It’s okay. I’ll watch over you. I’m right here. I’m staying right here.” Jessup stared at her fixedly as the life slowly ebbed out of his body and his chest became still</td>

<td>Lucy Gray smoothed his bangs and sat back on her heels. She heaved a deep sigh, and Coriolanus could feel her exhaustion. She shook her head as if to wake herself, then grabbed the nearest bottle of water, twisting off the top and draining it in a few gulps. A second followed, then a third, before she wiped her mouth with the back of her hand. She stood up and examined Jessup, then opened another bottle and poured it over his face, washing away the foam and spittle. From her pocket she took the white linen napkin that had lined the picnic box Coriolanus brought her the final night. She leaned down and used the edge to gently shut his eyelids, then shook out the cloth and covered his face to hide it from the audience.<br/><br/>The food parcels from Lysistrata thumping down around her seemed to bring Lucy Gray back to the moment, and she quickly scooped up the pieces of bread and cheese and stuffed them in her pockets. She gathered the bottles of water in her skirt, but pulled up short as Reaper appeared at the far end of the arena. Lucy Gray lost no time in vanishing into the nearest tunnel with her gifts. Reaper let her go but walked over to collect the last few water bottles in the fading light, taking note of Jessup but leaving his body alone.<br/><br/>Coriolanus thought it might bode well for later. If the tributes kept making a habit of scavenging the gifts of the fallen, they’d play right into the poisoning plan. He didn’t have much time to dwell on it, though, as Lepidus arrived to claim Lysistrata.<br/><br/>“Whoa!” Lepidus said. “That was unexpected! Did you know about the rabies?”<br/><br/>“Of course not. I would’ve alerted the authorities so they could test the raccoons in the zoo,” she said.<br/><br/>“What? You mean he didn’t bring it from the districts?” said Lepidus.<br/><br/>Lysistrata was firm. “No, he was bitten here in the Capitol.”<br/><br/>“At the zoo?” Lepidus looked worried. “A lot of us have been spending time at the zoo. A raccoon was over by my equipment, you know, scratching around with those weird little hands and —”<br/><br/>“You don’t have rabies,” Lysistrata said flatly.<br/><br/>Lepidus made a clawing motion with his fingers. “It was touching my things.”<br/><br/>“Did you have any questions about Jessup?” she asked.<br/><br/>“Jessup? No, I never got near him. Oh, um, you meant … Did you have any thoughts?” he asked.<br/><br/>“I do.” She took a deep breath. “What I’d like people to know about Jessup is that he was a good person. He threw his body over mine to protect me when the bombs started going off in the arena. It wasn’t even conscious. He did it reflexively. That’s who he was at heart. A protector. I don’t think he would’ve ever won the Games, because he’d have died trying to protect Lucy Gray.”<br/><br/>“Oh, like a dog or something.” Lepidus nodded. “A really good one.”<br/><br/>“No, not like a dog. Like a human being,” said Lysistrata.<br/><br/>Lepidus eyed her, trying to decipher whether she was joking. “Huh. Lucky, any thoughts from headquarters?”<br/><br/>The camera caught Lucky gnawing on a stubborn hangnail. “Oh, what? Hey! Nothing upstairs at present. Let’s peek back at that arena, shall we?”</td>

It was flattering, Coriolanus supposed, but not especially intimidating. Never mind, though. Popular had gotten Lucy Gray a pile of money. She was alive, watered, fed, and well stocked. Hopefully, she could hole up while the others thinned their ranks. Losing Jessup as her protector was a blow, but it would be easier for her to hide by herself.

Your shirt’s told me most of it.” From the floor she retrieved the shirt he’d worn in the arena. “Clothes speak to me, you know.” She smoothed it out on her lap and began to reconstruct the terrors of his night, first lifting the bloodstained slit in the material on the sleeve. “Right here. This is where the knife cut you.” Her fingers tracked the damage down the fabric. “All these little rips, and the way the dirt’s ground in, tell me you slid — or maybe even were dragged — which matches up with the scrape on your chin and the blood on your collar.” Tigris touched the neckline, then moved on. “This other sleeve, the way it’s torn, I’d say you caught it on barbed wire.

<td>Ma filled a large glass to the brim. She carved out a full quarter of the pie and plunked it onto a plate. “Do you like ice cream?” she asked. Several scoops of vanilla followed. She pulled a chair up to the surprisingly simple wooden table. It sat under a framed needlepoint of a mountain scene overlaid with a single word: HOME. “My sister sent me that. She’s the only one I really stay in touch with now. Or who stays in touch with me, I guess. Doesn’t really fit with the rest of the house, but I have my corner down here. Please, sit. Eat.”<br/><br/>Her corner boasted the table with three mismatched chairs, the needlepoint, and a shelf filled with little oddities. A pair of rooster salt and pepper shakers, a marble egg, and a soft doll with patched clothing. The sum total of the possessions, Coriolanus suspected, that she’d brought from home. Her shrine to District 2. It was pitiful, the way she clung to that backward mountain region. Poor little displaced person without a hope of ever fitting in, spending her days making custards for Avoxes who would never taste them, and pining for the past.

But you know that already. I can see it.

The man stood at a fancy stone fireplace, his tall frame propped up by an elbow on the mantel, staring down into where the flame would be in another season. Now the hearth was cold and empty, and Coriolanus had to wonder what he saw there that would provoke the profoundly sad expression on his face. One hand gripped the velvet lapel of his expensive smoking jacket, which seemed all wrong, like Mrs. Plinth’s designer dress or Sejanus’s suit.

This was to be personal, then, not business. “You’ve eaten? Of course, you couldn’t get out of the kitchen without my wife stuffing you like a turkey. Do you want a drink? A whiskey maybe?”<br/><br/>Adults had never offered him any beverage stronger than posca, which went quickly enough to his head. He couldn’t risk that for this exchange. “I don’t know where I’d put it,” he said with a laugh, patting his stomach as he settled himself into a chair. “But please, you go ahead.”<br/><br/>“Oh, I don’t drink.” Mr. Plinth folded himself into the facing chair and looked Coriolanus over. “You look like your father.”<br/><br/>“I hear that a lot,” said Coriolanus. “Did you know him?”<br/><br/>“Our business overlapped at times.” He drummed his long fingers on the arm of the chair. “It’s striking, the resemblance.

That “wonderful opportunity,” she had called it. “Transformative.” Coriolanus thought about what it had felt like to be in the arena, where there were no rules, no laws, no consequences to one’s actions. The needle of his moral compass had swung madly without direction. Fueled by the terror of being prey, how quickly he himself had become a predator, with no reservations about smashing Bobbin to death. He’d transformed, all right, but not into anything he was proud of — and being a Snow, he had more self-control than most. He tried to imagine what it would be like if the whole world played by those same rules. No consequences. People taking what they wanted, when they wanted, and killing for it if it came to that. Survival driving everything. There had been days during the war when they’d all been too scared to leave the apartment. Days when the lawlessness had made even the Capitol an arena.<br/><br/>Yes, the lack of law, that was at the heart of it. So people needed to agree on laws to follow. Was that what Dr. Gaul had meant by “social contract”? The agreement not to rob, abuse, or kill one another? It had to be. And the law required enforcement, and that was where control came in. Without the control to enforce the contract, chaos reigned. The power that controlled needed to be greater than the people — otherwise, they would challenge it. The only entity capable of this was the Capitol.<br/><br/></td>

Still full from the Plinths’ breakfast, he just couldn’t bring himself to swallow even a spoonful, and it required a quick exchange of his untouched bowl with Festus’s empty one to avoid a reprimand. “Here. Lima beans still taste like the war to me.”<br/><br/>“That’s me and oatmeal. One whiff and I want to hide in a bunker,” said Festus, who made quick work of the stuff. “Thanks.

As most people were only just registering the new development on the screen, her reaction seemed extreme. Afraid that Clemensia would spill the whole story in her panic, Coriolanus leaped up and wrapped his arms around her from behind, not sure if the move was meant to be comforting or confining. Clemensia went rigid but silent.<br/><br/>“They’re not here. They’re in the arena,” Coriolanus said in her ear. “You’re safe.” But he continued to hold on to her as the action unfolded</td>

<td>With the targets on the ground disposed of, most of the snakes regrouped under Teslee. Her grip on the pole began to fail, and she cried out to Mizzen for help, but he only shook his head, more stunned than malicious.<br/><br/>People in the audience began shushing each other then, although Coriolanus did not know why. As the hall quieted, he picked up on what sharper ears had detected. Somewhere, ever so faintly, someone was singing in the arena.<br/><br/>His girl.<br/><br/>Lucy Gray emerged from her tunnel moving in slow motion, and backward. She lifted each foot with care as she stepped behind herself, swaying gently to the rhythm of her music.<br/><br/>La, la, la, la,La, la, la, la, la, la,La, la, la, la, la, la …<br/><br/>That was the extent of the lyrics at the moment, but it was compelling nonetheless. Following her, as if mesmerized by the melody, came half a dozen snakes.<br/><br/>Coriolanus released Clemensia, who had calmed down, giving her a gentle push in Festus’s direction. He stepped toward the screen, holding his breath as Lucy Gray continued to back in and then curve around toward where Jessup’s body had lain. Her voice became louder as she, knowingly or not, worked her way back to the mic. Perhaps for one last song, one last performance.<br/><br/>None of the snakes were inclined to attack her, though. In fact, she seemed to be drawing them from around the arena. The bunch under Teslee’s pole thinned, a few dropped from the stands, and dozens slithered out of the tunnels to join in a general migration to Lucy Gray. They surrounded her, flocking in from all sides, making it impossible for her to continue retreating. The bright bodies undulated over her bare feet, curling around her ankles as she lowered herself gently onto a chunk of marble.<br/><br/>With the tips of her fingers, she spread her ruffles out in the dust, as if by way of invitation. As the snakes swarmed her, the faded fabric vanished, leaving her with a brilliant skirt of weaving reptiles</td>

As the rainy night cooled the hall, Coriolanus dozed in his chair, one eye half-open for any activity on the screen. The storm obscured all, and eventually he drifted off. Near dawn, he woke with a start and looked around. Vipsania, Urban, and Persephone slept soundly. From a few yards away, Clemensia’s large dark eyes shone in the dim light.<br/><br/>He did not want to be her enemy. If the Snow fortress was about to fall, he would need friends. Until the snake incident, he’d counted Clemensia among his best. And she’d always gotten on well with Tigris, too. But how to make amends?<br/><br/>Clemensia had one hand tucked inside her shirt, where she fingered the collarbone she’d presented in the hospital. The one covered in scales.<br/><br/>“Did they go away?” he whispered.<br/><br/>Clemensia tensed. “They’re fading. Finally. They said it may take as long as a year.”<br/><br/>“Are they painful?” It was the first time the idea had occurred to him.<br/><br/>“Not painful. They pull. On my skin.” She rubbed the scales. “It’s hard to explain.”<br/><br/>Heartened by the confidence, he took the plunge. “I’m sorry, Clemmie. Really. About all of it.”<br/><br/>“You didn’t know what she had planned,” said Clemensia.<br/><br/>“No, I didn’t. But after, in the hospital, I should’ve been there for you. I should’ve broken down the doors to make sure you were okay,” he insisted.<br/><br/>“Yes!” she said emphatically, but she seemed to relent a little. “But I know you were hurt, too. In the arena.”<br/><br/>“Oh, don’t make excuses for me.” He threw up his hands. “I’m worthless and we both know it!”<br/><br/>A hint of a smile. “Almost. I guess I should thank you for keeping me from making a complete fool of myself today.”<br/><br/>“Did I?” He squinted as if trying to recall. “All I remember is clinging to you. Not necessarily hiding behind you. But there was definitely clinging.”<br/><br/>She laughed a little but then became serious. “I shouldn’t have blamed so much on you. I’m sorry. I was terrified.”<br/><br/>“With good reason. I wish you hadn’t had to watch that today,” he said.<br/><br/>“Maybe it was cathartic. I feel better somehow,” she confessed. “Am I terrible?”<br/><br/>“No,” he said. “The only thing you are is brave.”<br/><br/></td>

They let the others sleep while they shared the last cheese tart in Coriolanus’s stash, talking of this and that and even rolling around the idea of trying to set up an alliance between Lucy Gray and Reaper in the arena. Since it seemed out of their control, they abandoned it. The two would pair up together or they would not.<br/><br/>“At least we’re allies again,” he said.<br/><br/>“Well, not enemies anyway,” Clemensia allowed.

<td>To his relief, Lucy Gray materialized just before noon in the shadows of a tunnel. She surveyed the arena and, judging it safe, stepped into the sunlight. The mud on the hem of her ruffled skirt had begun to cake, but the damp dress still clung to her. While Coriolanus ordered her a feast on his communicuff, Lucy Gray crossed to Reaper’s puddle and knelt. She scooped up water, slaking her thirst and washing her face. After combing out her hair with her fingers, she twisted it into a loose knot, finishing just as a dozen drones entered the arena.<br/><br/>She appeared not to notice them as she took a bottle from her pocket and dipped the neck into the puddle, collecting an inch or so of water. After swishing it around, Lucy Gray poured the water back into the puddle and was making to refill the bottle when the incoming drones caught her attention. As the food and water began to drop around her, she tossed away the old bottle and gathered her gifts into her skirt.<br/><br/>Lucy Gray started for the nearest tunnel but then glanced up at Reaper lolling in the stands. She changed course, hurried to his morgue, and lifted the flag material. Her lips moved as she counted the fallen.<br/><br/>“She’s trying to figure out who’s left in the Games,” Coriolanus said into the mic that Lepidus had pushed in his face.</td>

<td>She’s trying to run him to death, thought Coriolanus. And it might just work.<br/><br/>Reaper staggered a bit, as though drunk. Flag in tow, he made his way to his puddle, one of the few that hadn’t dried up during the afternoon. He dropped down on his knees and drank, slurping until only a muddy sludge remained on the bottom. As he sat back on his heels, a funny look crossed his face, and his fingers began to knead his ribs and chest. He vomited up a portion of the water, then retched for a while on his hands and knees before rising unsteadily. Still gripping the flag in one hand, he began to walk, in slow, uneven steps, back toward his morgue. Reaper had just made it when he collapsed on the ground, dragging himself in line next to Treech. One hand made an attempt to pull the flag over the group, but he managed only to cover himself partway before he drew in his limbs and went still.<br/><br/>Coriolanus sat frozen in anticipation. Was that it? Had he really won? The Hunger Games? The Plinth Prize? The girl? He studied Lucy Gray’s face as she watched Reaper from the stands, but she had a distant look, as if she were far away from the action in the arena</td>

He’d won glory, and a future, and maybe love, too. Any minute now, he’d have Lucy Gray in his arms. Oh, Snow lands on top; it most certainly does. He forced his cheeks to relax as he got to the door, and straightened his jacket to help conceal the tipsy mess he actually was. It wouldn’t do, somehow, to let Dr. Gaul see him like that.<br/><br/>When he opened the door to the high biology lab, he found only Dean Highbottom, sitting in his usual place at the table. “Close the door behind you.” Coriolanus obliged. Perhaps the dean wanted to congratulate him in private. Or even apologize for abusing him. A falling star might one day have need of a rising one. But as he approached the dean, a cold dread washed over him. There, arranged on the table like lab specimens, were three items: an Academy napkin stained with grape punch, his mother’s silver compact, and a dingy white handkerchief.<br/><br/>The meeting could not have lasted more than five minutes. Afterward, as agreed, Coriolanus headed directly to the Recruitment Center, where he became Panem’s newest, if not shiniest, Peacekeeper.</td>

<td>She gave you the compact?” Coriolanus’s heart dropped at the thought.<br/><br/>“Oh, don’t blame her. The Peacekeepers had to wrestle her to the ground to get the thing. Naturally, we do a thorough search of the victors when they leave the arena.” The dean cocked his head and smiled. “So smart about how she poisoned Wovey and Reaper. Not really fair play, but what’s to be done? Sending her back to District Twelve seems punishment enough. She said the rat poison was all her idea, that the compact had just been a token.”<br/><br/>“It’s true,” said Coriolanus. “It was. A token of my affection. I don’t know anything about any poison.”<br/><br/>“Let’s say I believe you, which I don’t. But let’s say I do. What, then, am I to make of this?” Dean Highbottom lifted the handkerchief with the tip of the pen. “One of the lab assistants found it in the snake tank yesterday morning. Everyone was baffled at first, checking their pockets to see if their own hankies had gone astray, because who else had been near the mutts? One young fellow actually claimed it, saying his allergies had been particularly bad and that he’d misplaced his handkerchief only a few days before. But just as he was offering his resignation, someone noticed the initials. Not yours. Your father’s. So delicately stitched in the corner.”<br/><br/>CXS. Stitched in the same white thread as the border. Part of the border pattern, really, so unassuming that you’d have to look carefully for it, but irrefutably there. Coriolanus never bothered to examine his daily handkerchief; he just stuffed one in his pocket as he headed out. There would’ve been a slim chance of denying the charge if the middle name hadn’t been so distinctive. Xanthos. The only name Coriolanus even knew that began with an X, and the only person who carried it was his father. Crassus Xanthos Snow</td>

<td>My dearest Coryo,It’s Monday night now, and the apartment echoes with your absence. The Grandma’am doesn’t quite seem to know what’s going on, as twice today she asked when you’d be home and should we wait on dinner. Word of your situation has begun to spread. I went to see Pluribus, and he said he’d heard any number of rumors: that you’d followed Lucy Gray to Twelve out of love, that you’d gotten drunk celebrating and signed up on a dare, that you’d broken the rules and sent Lucy Gray gifts in the arena yourself, that you had some kind of falling out with Dean Highbottom. I tell people that you’re doing your duty to your country, just as your father did.Festus, Persephone, and Lysistrata came by this evening, all very concerned about you, and Mrs. Plinth called to get your address. I think she means to write you.Our apartment is officially going on the market now, thanks to some help from the Dolittles. Pluribus says that, if we can’t find a place immediately, he has a couple of spare rooms we can use above the club, and that maybe I can help out with the costumes if he reopens it. He’s also placed several pieces of our furniture with buyers. He’s been very kind and says to send his regards to you and Lucy Gray. Have you been able to see her? That’s the one sweet spot in all this madness.I’m sorry this is so short, but it’s quite late, and I’ve so much to do. I just wanted to get something off to remind you how much you are loved and missed. I know how hard things must be, but don’t lose hope. It has sustained us through the darkest of times and will do so now. Please write and tell us of your life in 12. It may not seem ideal, but who knows where it may lead?SLOT,<br/>Tigris<br/><br/>Coriolanus buried his face in his hands. The Capitol making a mockery of the Snow name? The Grandma’am losing her mind? Their home a pair of shabby rooms above a nightclub, where Tigris stitched sequined unitards? Was this the fate of the magnificent Snow family</td>

A promotion from dish washing to dish scraping? Wasn’t it better to die now, quickly, than to drag it out painfully for years?<br/><br/>Somewhere — it seemed very distant — he heard a door bang shut.

Something where I could help anyone who’d been injured, Capitol or district, when violence breaks out. At least I wouldn’t do any harm. I just don’t know if I could ever kill anyone, Coryo.”<br/><br/>Coriolanus felt a stab of annoyance. Had Sejanus forgotten that it was his own reckless behavior that had led to Coriolanus killing Bobbin? That his selfishness had robbed his friend of the luxury of such a statement?

What a waste, he thought. What a waste of a dynasty.<br/><br/>“What about in a war?” he asked Sejanus. “You’re a soldier, you know.”<br/><br/>“I know. A war would be different, I guess,” said Sejanus. “But I would have to be fighting for something I believed in. I would have to believe it would make the world a better place. I’d still rather be a medic, but there isn’t much demand for them at the moment, it turns out. Without a war. They’ve got a long waiting list of people who’d like to be trained to work at the clinic.

Sounds like a perfect fit,” said Coriolanus.<br/><br/>“Because I’m too good with a gun,” Sejanus told him. “It’s true. I’m a crack shot. My father taught me from when I was tiny, and every week I had mandatory target practice. He considers it part of the family business.”<br/><br/>Coriolanus tried to process the information. “Why didn’t you hide it?”<br/><br/>“I thought I was. In reality, I shoot much better than I do in training. I tried not to stand out, but the rest of the squad is terrible.” Sejanus caught himself. “Not you.”<br/><br/>“Yes, me.” Coriolanus laughed. “Look, I think you’re making too much of this. It’s not like we have a hanging every day. And if it ever did come to it, just shoot to miss.”<br/><br/>But the words only fueled Sejanus. “And what if that means you, or Beanpole, or Smiley, end up dead? Because I didn’t protect you?”<br/><br/>“Oh, Sejanus!” Coriolanus burst out in exasperation. “You have to stop overthinking everything! Imagining every worst-case scenario. That isn’t going to happen. We’re all going to die right here, of old age or excessive mopping, whatever takes us first. In the meantime, quit hitting the target! Or invent a problem with your eyes! Or smash your hand in the door!”<br/><br/>“Stop being so self-indulgent, in other words,” said Sejanus.<br/><br/>“Well, so dramatic anyway. That’s how you ended up in the arena, remember?” asked Coriolanus.<br/><br/></td>

<td>Everything froze for an instant, then chaos erupted. A fist caught Coriolanus’s mouth, sending his own fists into action. He struck out arbitrarily, focused only on securing his own circle of safety. The same animal wildness he’d experienced when the tributes had hunted him down in the arena swept over him. Dr. Gaul’s voice echoed in his ears. “That’s mankind in its natural state. That’s humanity undressed.” And here was naked humanity again, and here again he was a part of it. Punching, kicking, his teeth bared in the darkness.<br/><br/></td>

Maybe he was not cut out to be a lover. Maybe he was more of a loner at heart. Coriolanus Snow, more loner than lover. One thing about Billy Taupe, he reeked of passionate feelings. Is that what Lucy Gray wanted? Passion, music, liquor, moonlight, and a wild boy who embraced them all? Not a perspiring Peacekeeper showing up at her door on a Sunday morning with a split lip and a sagging bag of ice.<br/><br/>He gave over the lead to Sejanus, following him up and down cinder paths without comment. Eventually, his companion would grow tired, and they could go back and catch up on their letter writing. Sejanus, Tigris, his friends, the faculty, all of them had been dead wrong about him. He’d never been motivated by love or ambition, only a desire to get his prize and a nice, quiet bureaucratic job pushing papers around and leaving him plenty of time to attend tea parties. Cowardly and … what had Dean Highbottom called her? Oh, yes, vapid. Vapid, like his mother. What a disappointment he’d have been to Crassus Xanthos Snow.</td>

Rare.”<br/><br/>Coriolanus agreed. “My grandmother grows roses in winter.

<td>Lucy Gray hummed now, testing out different chords behind the melody, while he admired the curve of her neck, the fineness of her skin. As he drew nearer, his foot landed on an old branch, which broke with a sharp snap. She sprang from the rock, twisting her body as she rose, her eyes wide with fear and the guitar held out as if to block a blow. For a moment, he thought she’d flee, but her alarm shifted to relief at the sight of him. She shook her head, as close as he’d ever seen her to embarrassed, as she propped her guitar against the rock. “Sorry. Still got one foot in the arena.”<br/><br/>If his brief foray in the Games had left him nervous and nightmarish, he could only imagine how damaged she was. The last month had upended their lives and changed them irrevocably. Sad, really, as they were both rather exceptional people, for whom the world had reserved its harshest treatment.<br/><br/>“Yes, it leaves quite an impression,” he said. They stood for a moment, drinking each other in, before they moved together. The bag of ice slid from his hand as she wrapped her arms around him, melting her body into his. He locked her in an embrace, remembering how scared he’d been for her, for himself, and how he hadn’t dared fantasize about this moment as it had seemed so unattainable. But here they were, safe in a beautiful meadow. Two thousand miles away from the arena. Awash in daylight, but none between them.<br/><br/></td>

<td>She caressed his cheek. “Oh, no. I could feel you looking out for me. With the water, and the food, and believe me, taking out Bobbin was major, even though I know it must have been awful for you. It sure was for me.” Lucy Gray admitted to three of her own kills. First Wovey, although that had not been targeted. She’d merely positioned a bottle of water with a few swallows and a bit of powder as if it had been dropped accidentally in the tunnels, and Wovey had been the one to find it. “I was gunning for Coral.” She claimed Reaper, whose puddle she’d poisoned, had contracted rabies when Jessup spat in his eye in the zoo. “So that was really a mercy killing. I spared him what Jessup went through. And taking out Treech with that viper was self-defense. Still not sure why those snakes loved me so. Not convinced it was my singing. Snakes don’t even hear well.”<br/><br/>So he told her. About the lab, and Clemensia, and Dr. Gaul’s plan to release the snakes into the arena, and how he’d secretly dropped his handkerchief, his father’s handkerchief, into the tank so they could become accustomed to her scent. “But they found it, loaded with DNA from both of us.”<br/><br/>“And that’s why you’re here? Not the rat poison in the compact?” she asked.<br/><br/>“Yes,” he said. “You covered beautifully for me on that one.”<br/><br/>“Did my best.” She considered things for a minute. “Well, that’s it, then. I saved you from the fire, and you saved me from the snakes. We’re responsible for each other’s lives now.”<br/><br/>“Are we?” he asked.<br/><br/>“Sure,” she said. “You’re mine and I’m yours. It’s written in the stars.”<br/><br/>“No escaping that.” He leaned over and kissed her, flushed with happiness, because although he did not believe in celestial writings, she did, and that would be enough to guarantee her loyalty. Not that his own loyalty was in question. If he hadn’t fallen in love with any of the girls in the Capitol, it was unlikely District 12 could offer much else in the way of temptation.</td>

Do you think, if I wrote to him, he could send me a few? I bet he has some leftover from when he ran his club. I can pay. I’ve still got most of the money Dean Highbottom gave me.”<br/><br/>Coriolanus stopped in his tracks. “Dean Highbottom? Dean Highbottom gave you money?”<br/><br/>“He did, but it was kind of on the quiet. First, he apologized for what I’d been through, then he stuffed a wad of cash into my pocket. Glad to have it. The Covey didn’t perform while I was gone. Too shook up over losing me,” she said. “Anyway, I can pay for those strings if he’s of a mind to help.”<br/><br/>Coriolanus promised to ask in his next letter, but the news of Dean Highbottom’s covert generosity threw him. Why would evil incarnate help his girlfriend? Respect? Pity? Guilt? Morphling-induced whimsy? He mulled it over as they made their way to her front porch, where she hitched Shamus to a post.<br/><br/>“Come on in. Meet the family.” Lucy Gray took his hand and led him to the door. “How’s Tigris? I sure wish I could’ve thanked her in person for the soap and my dress. Now that I’m home, I mean to send her a letter, and maybe a song if I come up with something good enough.”<br/><br/>“She’d like that,” said Coriolanus. “Things aren’t going so well at home.”<br/><br/>“I’m sure they miss you.

Two other Peacekeepers had signed up, one in his late twenties who claimed to have taken the test five times already and another who must have been pushing fifty, which seemed ancient for a life change.<br/><br/>Test-taking ranked among Coriolanus’s greatest talents, and he felt the familiar rush of excitement as he opened the cover of his booklet. He loved the challenge, and his obsessive nature meant almost instant absorption into the mental obstacle course. Three hours later, sweat-soaked, exhausted, and happy, he handed in his booklet and went to the mess hall for ice. He sat in the strip of shade his barrack provided, rubbing the cubes over his body and reviewing the questions in his head. The ache of losing his university career returned briefly, but he pushed it away with thoughts of becoming a legendary military leader like his father. Maybe this had been his destiny all along.</td>

Paired with an old-timer who immediately dozed off after instructing him to keep an eye out, he found his thoughts fixating on Lucy Gray, wishing he could see her, or at least talk to her. It seemed a waste to be on guard, where clearly nothing ever happened, when he could be holding her in his arms. He felt trapped here on base, while she could freely roam the night. In some ways, it had been better to have her locked up in the Capitol, where he always had a general idea of what she was doing.

As he watched Bug carry a newly baited cage up into the first tree and swap it with one holding a captured jabberjay, Dr. Kay came up behind him. “So, what do you think of the districts, Private Snow?”<br/><br/>He was trapped like a bird. Trapped like the tributes in the zoo. Fleeing into the trees was not an option. He remembered Lucy Gray’s advice that had saved him in the monkey house. Own it.<br/><br/>He turned to her with a smile sheepish enough to acknowledge her nailing him but amused enough to show he didn’t care. “You know, I think I learned more about Panem in one day as a Peacekeeper than I did in thirteen years of school.”<br/><br/>Dr. Kay laughed. “Yes. There’s a world of education to be had out here. I was assigned to Twelve during the war. Lived on your base. Worked in these woods.”<br/><br/>“You were part of the jabberjay project, then?” asked Coriolanus. At least they’d both had public failures.<br/><br/>“I headed it,” said Dr. Kay significantly.<br/><br/>A major public failure. Coriolanus felt more comfortable. He’d only embarrassed himself in the Hunger Games, not a nationwide war. Perhaps she would be sympathetic and give a favorable report to Dr. Gaul on her return if he made a good impression. Making an effort to engage her might pay off. He remembered that the jabberjays were all male and couldn’t reproduce with one another. “So these jabberjays, they were the actual birds you used for surveillance during the war?”<br/><br/>“Mm-hmm. These were my babies. Never thought I’d see them again. The general consensus was they wouldn’t last the winter. The genetically engineered often struggle in the wild.

<td>people, but surely he could pretend to be for a few hours. He squatted down beside the trap and examined the jabberjay, which chattered away. “You know, I never quite grasped how these worked.” Not that he’d made any effort to find out. “I know they recorded conversations, but how did you control them?”<br/><br/>“They’re trained to respond to audio commands. If we’re lucky, I can show you.” Dr. Kay pulled a small rectangular device from her pocket. Several colored buttons protruded from it, none of which were marked, but maybe age and use had worn the markings away. She knelt down across the cage from him and studied the bird with more affection than Coriolanus felt befitted a scientist. “Isn’t he beautiful?”<br/><br/>Coriolanus tried to sound convincing. “Very.”<br/><br/>“So, what you hear now, this chatter, it’s his own. He can mimic the other birds, or us, or say whatever he likes. He’s in neutral,” she said.<br/><br/>“In neutral?” Coriolanus asked.<br/><br/>“In neutral?” He heard his voice echo from the bird’s beak. “In neutral?”<br/><br/>Even creepier when it’s your own voice, he thought, but he gave a delighted laugh. “That was me!”<br/><br/>“That was me!” the jabberjay said in his voice, and then began to mimic a nearby bird.<br/><br/>“It was indeed,” said Dr. Kay. “But in neutral, he’ll move on to something else quickly. Another voice. Usually, just a short phrase. Or a snatch of birdsong. Whatever catches his fancy. For surveillance, we needed to put him in record mode. Fingers crossed.” She pressed one of the buttons on her remote control.<br/><br/>Coriolanus heard nothing. “Oh, no. I guess it’s too old.”<br/><br/>Dr. Kay’s face, however, wore a smile. “Not necessarily. The command tones are inaudible to human beings but easily registered by the birds. Notice how quiet he is?”<br/><br/>The jabberjay had fallen silent. It hopped around in its trap, cocking its head, pecking at things, the same in all ways except its verbalizing.<br/><br/>“Is it working?” asked Coriolanus.<br/><br/>“We’ll see.” Dr. Kay hit another button on her control, and the bird resumed its normal chirping. “Neutral again. Now let’s see what he’s retained.” She pressed a third button.<br/><br/>After a brief pause, the bird began to speak.<br/><br/>“Oh, no. I guess it’s too old.”<br/><br/>“Not necessarily. The command tones are inaudible to human beings but easily registered by the birds. Notice how quiet he is?”<br/><br/>“Is it working?”<br/><br/>“We’ll see.”<br/><br/>An exact replica. But no. The rustling of the trees, the buzzing of the insects, the other birds, none of that had been recorded. Only the pure sound of the human voices.<br/><br/>“Huh,” said Coriolanus, somewhat impressed. “How long can they record for?”<br/><br/>“An hour or so, on a good day,” Dr. Kay told him. “They’re designed to seek out forested areas and then are attracted to human voices. We’d release them into the woods in record mode, then retrieve them with a homing signal back at the base, where we’d analyze the recordings. Not just here, but in Districts Eleven, Nine, wherever we thought they’d be of value.”<br/><br/>“You couldn’t just set microphones in the trees?” Coriolanus asked.<br/><br/>“You can bug buildings, but the forest is too large. The rebels knew the terrain well; we didn’t. They moved from place to place. The jabberjay is an organic, mobile recording device and, unlike a microphone, it’s undetectable. The rebels could catch one, kill it, eat it even, and all they would find is an ordinary bird,” explained Dr. Kay. “They are perfect, in theory.”<br/><br/>“But in practice, the rebels figured out what they were,” said Coriolanus. “How did they manage that?”<br/><br/>“Not entirely sure. Some thought they saw the birds returning to base, but we only recalled them in the dead of night, in which they’re virtually impossible to detect, and only a few at a time. More likely we didn’t cover our tracks. Didn’t make sure that the information we acted on could have had a source other than a recording in the woods. That would’ve brought suspicion, and even though their black feathers are an excellent camouflage at night, their activity after hours would be a clue. Then, I think, they just started experimenting with them, feeding us false information and seeing how we reacted.” She shrugged. “Or maybe they had a spy on the base. I doubt we’ll ever really know.”<br/><br/>“Why don’t you just use the homing device to call them back to the base now? Instead of —” Coriolanus stopped himself, not wanting to seem like a whiner.<br/><br/>“Instead of dragging you out in this heat to be eaten alive by mosquitoes?” She laughed. “The whole transmission system was dismantled, and our old aviary seems to store supplies now. Besides, I’d rather have my hands on them. We don’t want them to fly off and never come back, do we?”<br/><br/></td>

<td>I’m not sure what they’ll do, now that they’ve gone native. At the end of the war, I released them on neutral. It would have been cruel otherwise. A mute bird would have faced too many challenges. They not only survived but mated successfully with the mockingbirds. So now we have a whole new species.” Dr. Kay pointed up at a mockingjay in the foliage. “Mockingjays, the locals call them.”<br/><br/>“And what can they do?” asked Coriolanus.<br/><br/>“Not sure. I’ve been watching them for the last few days. They’ve no ability to mimic speech. But they have a better, more sustained ability to repeat music than their mothers,” she said. “Sing something.”<br/><br/>Coriolanus only had one song in his repertoire.<br/><br/>Gem of Panem,Mighty city,Through the ages, you shine anew.<br/><br/>The mockingjay cocked its head and then sang back. No words, but an exact replica of the melody, in a voice that seemed half human, half bird. A few other birds in the area picked it up and wove it into a harmonic fabric, which again reminded him of the Covey with their old songs.<br/><br/>“We should kill them all.” The words slipped out before he could stop them.<br/><br/>“Kill them all? Why?” said Dr. Kay in surprise.<br/><br/>“They’re unnatural.” He tried to twist the comment so it sounded like it came from a bird lover. “Perhaps they’ll hurt the other species.”<br/><br/>“They appear to be rather compatible. And they’re all over Panem, wherever jabberjays and mockingbirds cohabited. We’ll take some back and see if they can reproduce, mockingjay with mockingjay. If they can’t, they’ll all be gone in a few years anyway. If they can, what’s one more songbird?” she said.<br/><br/>Coriolanus agreed they were probably harmless. He spent the rest of the afternoon asking questions and treating the birds gently to make up for his callous suggestion. He didn’t mind the jabberjays so much — they seemed rather interesting from a military standpoint — but something about the mockingjays repelled him. He distrusted their spontaneous creation. Nature running amok. They should die out, and die out soon.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, though they found themselves</td>

Otherwise, there’d be chaos and people running around killing each other, like in the arena.” This was the first time he’d tried to put these thoughts into words with anyone other than Dr. Gaul. He felt a little unsteady, like a toddler learning to walk, but he felt the independence of getting on his feet as well.<br/><br/>Lucy Gray drew back a bit. “That’s what you think people would do?”<br/><br/>“I do. Unless there’s law, and someone enforcing it, I think we might as well be animals,” he said with more assurance. “Like it or not, the Capitol is the only thing keeping anyone safe.”<br/><br/>“Hm. So they keep me safe. And what do I give up for that?” she asked.</td>

He felt his body tense and the pleasant drowsiness drain away. But the Covey were all smiles as the birds ran off with the song.<br/><br/>“Like sandstones to diamonds, that’s what we are to them,” said Tam Amber.<br/><br/>“Well … they practice more,” said Clerk Carmine, and the others laughed.<br/><br/>Listening to the birds, Coriolanus noticed the absence of jabberjays. The only explanation he could think of was that the mockingjays had begun to reproduce without them, either with one another or with the local mockingbirds. This elimination of the Capitol birds from the equation deeply disturbed him. Here they were, multiplying like rabbits, completely unchecked. Unauthorized. Co-opting Capitol technology.

<td>Coriolanus began to warm up to the jabberjays. They really were impressive pieces of engineering. A few of the remotes lay around the lab, and the scientists allowed him to play with the birds once they’d been cataloged. “It won’t hurt anything,” one said. “In fact, they seem to enjoy the interaction.” Bug wouldn’t participate, but when he grew bored, Coriolanus made them record silly phrases and sing bits of the anthem, seeing how many he could operate with one remote click. Up to four sometimes, if their cages were close together. He always took care to erase them by doing a final quick recording in which he was silent, ensuring his voice would not end up back in the Citadel lab. He stopped with the singing entirely when the mockingjays began to pick it up, even if there was a certain satisfaction in hearing them pipe out praise for the Capitol. He had no way to silence them, and they could string one melody out endlessly.<br/><br/>On the whole, he was beginning to weary of the infusion of music into his life. Invasion might be a better word. It seemed to be everywhere these days: birdsong, Covey song, bird-and-Covey song. Perhaps he did not share his mother’s love of music after all. At least, such a quantity of it. It consumed his attention greedily, demanding to be listened to and making it hard to think.</td>

Free to rejoin the human race without fear. Tears of relief flooded his eyes, and he began to laugh out of sheer joy. How would he do it? Burn it in a bonfire? Disassemble it and scatter the parts to the four winds? Throw it into the lake? Once the gun was gone, there’d be nothing to connect him to the murders. Absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>No, wait. There would be one thing. Lucy Gray.<br/><br/>Well, no matter. She would never tell. She wouldn’t be thrilled, obviously, when he told her there’d been a change of plans. That he was returning to the Peacekeepers and heading to District 2 tomorrow at dawn, essentially leaving her to her fate. Still, she’d never rat him out. It wasn’t her style, and it would implicate her in the murders as well. It would mean she could wind up dead, and as the Hunger Games had shown, Lucy Gray possessed an extraordinary talent for self-preservation. Plus, she loved him. She’d said so last night in the song. Even more, she trusted him. Although, if he ditched her in the woods to claw out an existence alone, no doubt she would consider that a breach of faith. He had to think of just the right way to break the news. But what would that be? “I love you deeply, but I love officers’ school more?” That wasn’t going to go over well.<br/><br/>And he did love her! He did! It was just that, only a few hours into his new life in the wilderness, he knew he hated it. The heat, and the worms, and those birds yakking nonstop …<br/><br/>She was certainly taking a long time with those potatoes.<br/><br/>Coriolanus glanced out the window. The rain had diminished to a sprinkle.<br/><br/>She hadn’t wanted to go by herself. Too lonely. Her song said that she needed, loved, and trusted him, but would she forgive him? Even if he deserted her? Billy Taupe had crossed her, and he’d ended up dead. He could hear him now …<br/><br/>“Makes me sick how you’re playing the kids. Poor Lucy Gray. Poor lamb.”<br/><br/>… and see her sinking her teeth into his hand. He thought about how coolly she’d killed in the arena. First that frail little Wovey; that was a cold-blooded move if he’d ever seen one. Then the calculated way she’d taken out Treech, baiting him to attack her, really, so she could whip that snake out of her pocket. And she claimed that Reaper had rabies, that it was a mercy kill, but who knew?<br/><br/>No, Lucy Gray was no lamb. She was not made of sugar. She was a victor.<br/><br/>He checked to see that the Peacekeeper’s rifle was loaded, then opened the door wide. She was nowhere in sight.

<td>No question, she was hiding from him. But why? There could only be one answer. Because she’d figured it out. All of it. That destroying the guns would wash away all physical evidence of his connection to the murders. That he no longer wanted to run away. That she was the last witness to tie him to the crime. But they’d always had each other’s backs, so why would she suddenly think he might harm her? Why, when only yesterday, he’d been pure as the driven snow?<br/><br/>Sejanus. She must have figured out that Sejanus was the third person Coriolanus had killed. She wouldn’t have to know anything about the stunt with the jabberjays, only that he’d been Sejanus’s confidant, and that Sejanus was a rebel, while Coriolanus was a defender of the Capitol. Still, to think he’d kill her? He looked down at the loaded gun in his hands. Maybe he should’ve left it in the shed. It looked bad coming after her armed. As if he was hunting her. But he wasn’t really going to kill her. Just talk to her and make sure she saw sense.<br/><br/>Put down the gun, he told himself, but his hands refused to cooperate. All she has is a knife. A big knife. The best he could manage was to sling the gun onto his back. “Lucy Gray! Are you okay? You’re scaring me! Where are you?”<br/><br/>All she’d have to say was “I understand, I’ll go on alone, like I was planning to all along.” But just this morning she’d admitted she didn’t think she could make it on her own, that she’d return to the Covey after a few days. She knew he wouldn’t believe her.<br/><br/>“Lucy Gray, please, I just want to talk to you!” he shouted. What was her plan here? To hide until he grew tired and went back to the base? And then sneak back home tonight? That didn’t work for him. Even with the murder weapon gone, she’d still be dangerous. What if she went back to District 12 now and the mayor succeeded in getting her arrested? What if they interrogated or even tortured her? The story would come out. She hadn’t killed anyone. He had. His word against hers. Even if they didn’t believe her, his reputation would be destroyed. Their romance would be revealed, along with the details of how he’d cheated in the Hunger Games. Dean Highbottom might be brought in as a character witness. He couldn’t risk it.<br/><br/>Still no sign of her. She was giving him no choice but to hunt</td>

<td> patch of orange caught his eye, and he smiled. “I don’t want you to lose me,” she’d said. And he hadn’t. He pushed through the branches and into a small clearing canopied by trees. The orange scarf lay across some briars, where it had apparently blown loose and snagged as she fled. Oh, well. It confirmed he was on the right track. He went to retrieve it — maybe he’d keep it after all — when a faint rustle in the leaves pulled him up short. He’d just registered the snake when it struck, uncoiling like a spring and digging its teeth into the forearm extended toward the scarf.<br/><br/>“Aa!” he screamed in pain. It released him immediately and slithered into the brush before he even had a chance to get a good look at it. Panic set in as he stared at the red, arched bite mark on his forearm. Panic and disbelief. Lucy Gray had tried to kill him! This was no coincidence. The trailing scarf. The poised snake. Maude Ivory had said she always knew where to find them. This was a booby trap, and he’d walked straight into it! Poor lamb, indeed! He was beginning to sympathize with Billy Taupe.<br/><br/>Coriolanus knew nothing about snakes, other than the rainbow ones in the arena. Feet rooted to the ground, heart racing, he expected to die on the spot, but while the wound hurt, he was still standing. He didn’t know how long he might have, but by all things Snow, she was going to pay for this. Should he tie off the arm with a tourniquet? Suck out the venom? They hadn’t done survival training yet. Afraid his first aid treatments might only spread the poison more swiftly through his system, he yanked his sleeve down over his forearm, pulled his rifle off his shoulder, and started after her. If he’d felt better, he’d have laughed at the irony of how quickly their relationship had deteriorated into their own private Hunger Games.<br/><br/>She wasn’t so easy to track now, and he realized the earlier clues had been left to lead him directly to the snake. But she couldn’t be that far away. She’d want to know if the thing killed him, or if she should form another plan of attack. Maybe she hoped he’d pass out so she could cut his throat with the long knife. Trying to quiet his panting, he moved deeper into the woods, gently pushing the branches back with the nose of his rifle, but it was impossible to discern her whereabouts.</td>

He peeled off his clothes and scrubbed off the last bits of the lake.

<td>Did you think about the Hunger Games?” she asked. “The day we met, Casca asked you what their purpose was, and you gave the stock answer. To punish the districts. Would you change that now?”<br/><br/>Coriolanus remembered the conversation he’d had with Sejanus as they’d unpacked his duffel. “I’d elaborate on it. They’re not just to punish the districts, they’re part of the eternal war. Each one is its own battle. One we can hold in the palm of our hand, instead of waging a real war that could get out of our control.”<br/><br/>“Hm.” She swung a mouse away from a gaping mouth. “You there, don’t be greedy.”<br/><br/>“And they’re a reminder of what we did to each other, what we have the potential to do again, because of who we are,” he continued.<br/><br/>“And who are we, did you determine?” she asked.<br/><br/>“Creatures who need the Capitol to survive.” He couldn’t help getting in a dig. “It’s all pointless, though, you know. The Hunger Games. No one in Twelve even watches it. Except for the reaping. We didn’t even have a working television on base.”<br/><br/>“While that could be a problem in the future, it’s a blessing this year, given that I’ve had to erase the whole mess,” said Dr. Gaul. “It was a mistake getting the students mixed up in it. Especially when they started dropping like flies. Presented the Capitol as far too vulnerable.”<br/><br/>“You erased it?” he asked.<br/><br/>“Every last copy gone, never to be aired again.” She grinned. “I’ve a master in the vault, of course, but that’s just for my own amusement.”<br/><br/>He was glad about the erasure. It was just one more way to eliminate Lucy Gray from the world. The Capitol would forget her, the districts barely knew her, and District 12 had never accepted her as one of their own. In a few years, there would be a vague memory that a girl had once sung in the arena. And then that would be forgotten, too. Good-bye, Lucy Gray, we hardly knew you.<br/><br/>“Not a total loss. I think we’ll bring Flickerman back next year. And your idea about the betting is a keeper,” she said.<br/><br/>“You need to somehow make the viewing mandatory. No one in Twelve will tune in to something that depressing by choice,” he told her. “They spend what little free time they have drinking to forget the rest of their lives.”<br/><br/>Dr. Gaul chuckled. “It seems you’ve learned a lot on your summer vacation, Mr. Snow.”<br/><br/>“Vacation?” he said, perplexed.<br/><br/>“Well, what were you going to do here? Laze around the Capitol, combing out your curls? I thought a summer with the Peacekeepers would be far more educational.” She took in the confusion on his face. “You don’t think I’ve invested all this time in you to hand you off to those imbeciles in the districts, do you?”<br/><br/>“I don’t understand, I was told —” he began.<br/><br/>She cut him off. “I’ve ordered you an honorable discharge, effective immediately. You’re to study under me at the University.”<br/><br/>“The University? Here in the Capitol?” he said in surprise.<br/><br/>She dropped one last mouse into the tank. “Classes start Thursday.”</td>

He looked gorgeous in his new suit, especially with the return of his curls, and his stint as a Peacekeeper had given him a certain cachet that drove his rivals wild.<br/><br/>He’d just finished a special honors class in military strategy with Dr. Gaul, after a morning at the Citadel, where he’d reported for his Gamemaker internship. If you wanted to call it that — really the others treated him as a full-fledged member of the team. They were already working on ideas to engage the districts, as well as the Capitol, in next year’s Hunger Games. Snow had been the one to point out that, other than the life of two tributes they might not even know, the people in the districts had no stake in the Games. A tribute’s win needed to be a win for the whole district. They’d come up with the idea that everyone in the district would receive a parcel of food if their tribute took the crown. And to tempt a better class of tributes to possibly volunteer, Snow suggested that the victor should be given a house in a special area of town, tentatively called the Victor’s Village, which would be the envy of all those people in the hovels. That, and a token monetary prize, should go a long way toward bringing in a decent crop of performers.</td>

<td>His fingers stroked his butter-soft leather satchel, a back-to-school gift from the Plinths. He still tripped over what to call them. “Ma” was easy enough, but it didn’t suit to call Strabo Plinth his father, so he used “sir” a lot. It wasn’t as if they’d adopted him; he’d been too old at eighteen. Being designated an heir worked better for him anyway. He’d never give up the name Snow, not even for a munitions empire.<br/><br/>It had all happened very naturally. His homecoming. Their grief. The merging of the families. Sejanus’s death had totaled the Plinths. Strabo had put it simply: “My wife needs something to live for. So do I, for that matter. You’ve lost your parents. We’ve lost our son. I was thinking perhaps we could work something out.” He’d bought the Snows’ apartment so they didn’t have to move, and the Dolittles’ below it for himself and Ma. There was talk of renovating, of building a spiral staircase and perhaps a private elevator to connect the two, but there was no rush. Ma already came by daily to help with the Grandma’am, who’d resigned herself to having a new “maid,” and she and Tigris got on swimmingly. The Plinths paid for everything now: the taxes on the apartment, his tuition, the cook. They gave him a generous allowance as well. This was helpful because, although he’d intercepted and pocketed the envelope of money he’d sent Tigris from District 12, university life was expensive when done right. Strabo never questioned his expenditures or nitpicked over a few new additions to his wardrobe, and he seemed pleased when Snow asked for advice. They were surprisingly compatible. At times, he almost forgot old Plinth was district. Almost.<br/><br/>Tonight would’ve been Sejanus’s nineteenth birthday, and they were gathering for a quiet dinner to remember him. Snow had invited Festus and Lysistrata to join the party, as they’d liked Sejanus better than most of his classmates and could be counted on to say nice things. </td>

<td>He planned to present the Plinths with the box from Sejanus’s locker, but first he had one more thing to do.<br/><br/>The fresh air on the walk to the Academy left his mind razor sharp. He hadn’t bothered to make an appointment, preferring to drop in unexpectedly. The students had been let out an hour ago, and his footsteps rang in the hallways. Dean Highbottom’s secretary’s desk was empty, so he crossed to the dean’s office and tapped on the door. Dean Highbottom bid him enter. Between the weight loss and the tremor, he looked worse than ever, slumped over his desk.<br/><br/>“Well, to what do I owe this honor?” he asked.<br/><br/>“I was hoping to recover my mother’s compact, since you should have no further need of it,” Snow replied.<br/><br/>Dean Highbottom reached into a drawer and slapped the compact on the desk. “Is that all?”<br/><br/>“No.” He removed Sejanus’s box from his satchel. “I’m returning Sejanus’s personal effects to his parents tonight. I’m not sure what to do with this.” He emptied the contents onto the desk and picked up the framed diploma. “I didn’t think you’d want it floating around out there. An Academy diploma. Awarded to a traitor.”<br/><br/>“You’re very conscientious,” said Dean Highbottom.<br/><br/>“That’s my Peacekeeper training.” Snow loosened the back of the frame and slipped out the diploma. Then, as if on impulse, he replaced it with a photo of the Plinth family. “I think his parents will prefer this anyway.” They both stared at the remains of Sejanus’s life. Then he swept the three medicine bottles into Dean Highbottom’s trash can. “The fewer bad memories, the better.”<br/><br/>Dean Highbottom eyed him. “So, you grew a heart in the districts?”<br/><br/>“Not in the districts. In the Hunger Games,” Snow corrected him. “I have you to thank for that. After all, you’re responsible for them.”<br/><br/>“Oh, I think half the credit for that goes to your father,” said the dean.<br/><br/>Snow frowned. “How do you mean? I thought the Hunger Games were your idea. Something you came up with at the University?”<br/><br/>“For Dr. Gaul’s class. Which I was failing, since my loathing of her made participation impossible. We paired off for the final project, so I was with my best friend — Crassus, of course. The assignment was to create a punishment for one’s enemies so extreme that they would never be allowed to forget how they had wronged you. It was like a puzzle, which I excel at, and like all good creations, absurdly simple at its core. The Hunger Games. The evilest impulse, cleverly packaged into a sporting event. An entertainment. I was drunk and your father got me drunker still, playing on my vanity as I fleshed the thing out, assuring me it was just a private joke. The next morning, I awoke, horrified by what I’d made, meaning to rip it to shreds, but it was too late. Without my permission, your father had given it to Dr. Gaul. He wanted the grade, you see. I never forgave him.”<br/><br/>“He’s dead,” said Snow.<br/><br/>“But she isn’t,” Dean Highbottom shot back. “It was never meant to be anything more than theoretical. And who but the vilest monster would stage it? After the war, she pulled my proposal out, and me with it, introducing me to Panem as the architect of the Hunger Games. That night, I tried morphling for the first time. I thought the thing would die out, it was so ghastly. It didn’t. Dr. Gaul took it and ran, and she has dragged me along with it for the last ten years.”<br/><br/>“It certainly supports her view of humanity,” said Snow. “Especially using the children.”<br/><br/>“And why is that?” asked Dean Highbottom.<br/><br/>“Because we credit them with innocence. And if even the most innocent among us turn to killers in the Hunger Games, what does that say? That our essential nature is violent,” Snow explained.<br/><br/>“Self-destructive,” Dean Highbottom murmured.<br/><br/>Snow remembered Pluribus’s account of his father’s falling out with Dean Highbottom and quoted the letter. “Like moths to a flame.” The dean’s eyes narrowed, but Snow only smiled and said, “But, of course, you’re testing me. You know her far better than I do.”</td>

If he ever married, he’d choose someone incapable of swaying his heart. Someone he hated, even, so they could never manipulate him the way Lucy Gray had. Never make him feel jealous. Or weak.

He’d continue the Games, of course, when he ruled Panem. People would call him a tyrant, ironfisted and cruel.

<td>Needlework, spinning and other textile skills provided women with a means of expression. ‘The needle is your writing brush,’ as Ding Pei, a famous female embroiderer, wrote in a treatise published in 1821. Spinning, lacemaking, sericulture, embroidery and other textile-related crafts could give women economic power and status. In England in 1750, for example, spinning was the most common paid form of employment for women and a relatively lucrative one at that. Single women were estimated at the time to be able to spin around six pounds of wool per week; a married woman would probably only be able to manage two and a half pounds. Given the current rates offered, a spinster would therefore have been able to earn as much in a week as a skilled weaver – who were more usually men and were often in guilds, meaning their work was thought of as more valuable. It is only more recently that the word spinster has picked up negative connotations.19</td>

<td>While this tale is familiar, less well known is the historical King Midas, the likely model for the myth. He ruled Phrygia, an ancient state in what is now Turkey, in the last decades of the eighth century BC. He makes an appearance in Greek historical records, but archaeological traces remain too. The Phrygian capital of Gordion was razed in the early seventh century BC, and its destruction was so swift that the city and much of what was within it burned where it stood. Excavations of the citadel turned up a great many things abandoned in the rush. One of the most extraordinary finds were over 2,000 loom weights discovered in neat rows within a hundred metres of each other, lying where they had dropped as the flames consumed the cloth they hung from. Given this number, over a hundred women must have been busily weaving cloth for the Phrygian ruler when the city was destroyed. ‘No wonder’, Elizabeth Barber wryly notes, ‘the Greeks viewed Midas as synonymous with gold!’13</td>

The Bayeux Tapestry, to take one famous example, was likely designed and produced by English craftswomen to record the Norman victory over their own countrymen in the eleventh century. Despite this, it is a work of great skill and beauty, recording around fifty scenes, graphic-novel style, using only eight colours of worsted and a length of tabby-weave linen nearly seventy metres long.

Amaterasu, the Japanese sun goddess, weaves, as does the weaver girl of Chinese mythology, but only when she is separated from her husband, the cowherd, by the Milky Way. (Their separation was in fact engineered so that she wouldn’t neglect her needlework.)<br/> Stories of fierce fertility goddesses, nimble-fingered old crones and vengeful maidens were sustained over the centuries by women, unravelled and rewoven daily, like Penelope’s tapestry, by countless retellings. Tales were spun, murmuring, to offspring in the dark, or recounted to companions as they sat and created cloth of their own. The making of thread and textiles, after all, has for centuries been seen as women’s work. This is perhaps because it was the form of work most compatible with child-rearing: it could be done at home with only half an eye by those with experience, and could also usually be interrupted and resumed at will.<br/></td>

He was among the first of a new generation that could lie in the grass for all eternity if they wanted.<br/>But there was still no such thing as true immortality, if you thought about it. Because as long as there were scythes, there would always be death. That was why everyone prized a year of immunity so much. Because deep down, they knew that even more terrifying than death was the fear of it. In a world where the Thunderhead knew just about everything there was to know, death was one of the few unknowns left. Which, perhaps, is why the Thunderhead declared that it would divorce itself from the very concept, and allow death to remain a human endeavor to be nurtured and maintained by scythes. Humanity’s so-called immortality only replaced one impossible question—What do I do with my brief time on Earth?—with another equally impossible one:<br/>What do I do with more time than I’ll ever </td>

The other regions had been spineless, all allowing Goddard to roll over them like a mortal-age conqueror.

A scythe whose name brought a smile to people’s lips.<br/>Unlike Scythe Dalí, this scythe’s robe was not eye-catching. His was an old woolen tunic, colored in natural, earthy tones. His deep, contemplative eyes would often be turned to the pages of a mortal-age book, his hand pensively stroking a graying beard—because although he could choose any age to maintain, he maintained himself at a respectable sixty. He believed no one deserved youth more than once, much less a scythe. When he wasn’t out performing that most hallowed service of gleaning, he could be found in the gardens of Park Güell, cultivating flowers with the patience of a saint. Because, as he often said, first love was required, and then second came technique. It was a philosophy based on the teachings of his Patron Historic.<br/>He never gleaned on the expansive grounds of Park Güell. Everyone knew the park was a safe haven for those who visited—and many did. The revered scythe would walk among people as they strolled, taking in the glorious mosaic sculptures that graced the park; whimsical spiraling candy-like structures created by his Patron Historic. He would smile at children and they would smile back, then ask their parents who was this strange man who had allowed himself to get old. “That is none other than Scythe Gaudí,” they would whisper. Always whisper.<br/>Today, however, Scythe Gaudí had a mission that took him away from his beloved park.</td>

By Sylvi’s day, the ruler of the pegasi had for many generations been expected to do ritualised homage to the ruler of the humans on feast days, and to attend the royal court, with a suitable entourage of attendant pegasi, often enough to be seen as a regular presence. Some human rulers were greater sticklers about frequency than others, just as some pegasi rulers appeared to enjoy the visits, or appeared not to, more than others.

He and his wife, one of the queen’s sisters, had each a bound pegasus, but they usually only saw them on trips to the palace: “Can you imagine a Speakers’ Guild magician living on a farm?” But both pegasi occasionally visited. “It’s a funny thing, the animals like ’em,” said her uncle, whose name was Rulf. “ They always insist on sleeping outside—we’ve got a perfectly good room at the end of the house with doors that open out under that big old oak tree. But they sleep outdoors. In bad weather they may sleep in the barn. And wherever they are, the animals drift that way.

Sylvi was sure it was more than she deserved, and made her new long complicated binding-ritual bow back, because it was the fanciest one she knew.Oyry, Farley’s pegasus, had just barely, or not quite, brushed the back of each of her hands with a wingtip, which was a salute she knew, and knew to be a great honour: not only did it just or not quite defy the ban on physical contact between pegasus and human, it was a reference to the longing humans had for wings and pegasi for strong human hands. Then he smiled a pegasus smile at her, which involved ears going in different directions and a wrinkled nose which did not expose the teeth. She’d been startled, and startled into wondering if perhaps she’d underestimated her brothers’ pegasi. It was a point of honour as a much-patronised little sister to underestimate her brothers. But it was so hard to guess anything about any pegasus, and she wondered uneasily what Oyry or Poih might know about her pegasus, who was, presumably, their little sister.

And then you seem to wake up, only it’s still there.”He stopped looking at nothing and looked at his daughter, and smiled, but it was a rather grim smile. “And then you really feel sick, because you know what that’s just happened means.” Her father, Sylvi knew, had been given the Sword in a quiet ceremony of transfer on his thirtieth birthday, when his mother retired, but the Sword had acknowledged him as heir in the great public ritual of acceptance ten years before. “Afterward my mother said—” He stopped.“What did Grandmother say?” Sylvi only barely remembered her father’s mother, who had died when Sylvi was four years old: a Sword-straight and Sword-thin old lady who looked desperately forbidding in her official retired-sovereign robes, but who somehow became benign and comforting (if a little bony) as soon as she picked tiny Sylvi up and smiled at her.The king looked at his daughter for another long minute and then said, “She said she felt twenty years younger and six inches taller.”Sylvi shivered.“You get used to it,” said the king. “You have to. And you’re trained for it. Well—we’ve been trained for it, some generations now. I’ve often wondered how one of those unexpected battlefield transfers happens—how whoever the Sword has gone to copes. It’s shocking and disorienting enough when it happens in the Little Court. Fortunately it doesn’t happen that way very often. And you, my dear, do not need to worry: Danacor is very healthy and very responsible. And you have two more brothers to spare.”Danacor’s sense of responsibility was such a family joke (as Sylvi had told her cousins, especially Faadra, who was inclined to be sweet on him) that when Sylvi asked her oldest brother what being accepted was like, she was not prepared for the king’s heir to look hunted, and reply immediately, “Like the worst dressing-down you’ve ever had, and a little bit over, except the Sword doesn’t talk, of course—it sort of looks at you.” He fell silent and stared into space just as his father had. “You come out of it thinking that you’d be better off asking one of the magicians to turn you into a rat and get it over with, and then you look around and everyone’s cheering and you can’t imagine what’s going on.”</td>

The words were just as stiff and silly (she was rather relieved to discover) as the ones she’d had to say.He stopped whuffling and added, I was going to say hee ho, ho hee, your wings are too short, you’ll never catch me, but my dad said he was going to be listening and I’d better get it right.

<td>Sylvi had some trouble with “sculptor,” although she heard the word clearly enough and she knew a little about the Caves: it was one of the things you learnt about the pegasi, with the Alliance and the gesture-language. The Caves had been there when the pegasi came, so long ago that even the pegasi only had myths about their origins; but, while extensive, they had been much smaller and far less beautiful. Thousands of years of pegasus sculptors, rubbing and smoothing and chipping and carving, using such small tools as their frail feather-hands could hold, and the Caves were—so beautiful you can’t really stay there long, you want to jump out of your skin and run for it. They’re perfect, you know, even though they’re not finished—will never be finished—it’s part of their perfection, that it goes on and on into the future and you’ll never see it, that us little short-lived mortals create perfection by not being there long, although we keep coming, us and our sons and daughters and their sons and daughters and so on.... Sorry. I’m sounding like a grown-up.But the sculptors themselves don’t stay inside long—a few weeks or months—and then they come out and join us in the fields for a while, although they mostly don’t like to go far. “Remember how to not fly,” is the proverb: remember how to walk. They come out and join us in the fields. And teach their beginning apprentices sculpting on the pillars of the shfeeah. The Caves knock your Courts hollow, although this one’s pretty nice, he added, looking round consideringly. But it’s only barely just been built.Sylvi, fascinated, forbore to say that the Outer Court was one of the oldest bits of the palace, over seven hundred years old.You can see it too clearly, Ebon went on, where it begins and ends, your Court.

I would not be your father, the human king, to have the winning of that old war carried on my back, and on the backs of all the kings and queens after me, until the end of humans and pegasi—and the winning of any other wars. We are free, we pegasi, thanks to you. We are glad to honour you in this way if it pleases you—if it means you’ll go on carrying the burden for both of us. In what Sylvi was already learning was a typical Ebon manner, he added, Mind you, I wouldn’t want to be my dad either—he still has to listen to all the bickering when someone feels left out of some decision—and he has to listen to people like Gaaloo go on and on because usually there’s about six important words in what Gaaloo says that nobody else thinks of and since my dad’s king, he’d better hear them.</td>

If this synchronized brainwave pattern were sufficiently stable, it might begin to resemble a condition known in chaos theory as “phase lock.” Phase locking occurs in nature when individual oscillating systems shift from a state of collective chaos to integrated resonance. For example, if individual cells from a chicken embryo heart are separated from each other, they beat erratically. If they are recombined one by one, when a certain number of cells are present, they spontaneously phase lock and begin to beat in unison.17</td>

<td>But suppose we come to a circumstance in which the mean free path is longer than the size of the transistor; then we discover that the transistor doesn’t work properly anymore. It does not behave the way we expected. This reminds me, years ago there was something called the sound barrier. Airplanes were supposed not to be able to go faster than the speed of sound because, if you designed them normally and then tried to put the speed of sound in the equations, the propeller wouldn’t work and the wings don’t lift and nothing works correctly. Nevertheless, airplanes can go faster than the speed of sound. You just have to know what the right laws are under the right circumstances, and design the device with the correct laws. You cannot expect old designs to work in new circumstances. But new designs can work in new circumstances, and I assert that it is perfectly possible to make transistor systems, or, more correctly, switching systems and computing devices, in which the dimensions are smaller than the mean free path. I speak, of course, “in principle,” and I am not speaking about the actual manufacture of such devices. Let us therefore discuss what happens if we try to make the devices as small as possible.<br/> </td>

You don’t know how you got there and you have to build them up again, and if you’re interrupted and kind of forget half the idea of how the cards went together–your cards being different-type parts of the ideas, ideas of different kinds that have to go together to build up the idea–the main point is, you put the stuff together, it’s quite a tower and it’s easy [for it] to slip, it needs a lot of concentration–that is, solid time to think–and if you’ve got a job in administrating anything like that, then you don’t have the solid time.

<td>The water analog of this would be to have a U-shaped tube with a valve in the center at the bottom, connecting the two arms of the U (Fig. 2). We start with it full on the right but empty on the left with the valve closed. If we now open the valve, the water will slip over to the other side, and we can close the valve again, just in time to catch the water in the left arm. Now when we want to go the other way, we open the valve again and the water slips back to the other side and we catch it again. There is some loss and the water doesn’t climb as high as it did before, but all we have to do is to put a little water in to correct the loss–a much smaller energy loss than the direct fill method. This trick uses the inertia of the water and the analog for electricity is inductance. However, it is very difficult with the silicon transistors that we use today to make up inductance on the chips. So this technique is not particularly practical with present technology.</td>

It was a genuine phenomenon, that conclusion: a community of skeptics and rationalists and followers of the scientific method deciding that there were some things Man was having too good a time to know. Coming to think of Minnie and Earl as family didn’t take much longer than that. For the next three years, until I left for my new job in the outer system, I went out to their place at least once, sometimes twice a week; I shot pool with Earl and chatted about relatives back home with Minnie; I’d tussled with Miles and helped with the dishes and joined them for long all-nighters talking about nothing in particular. I learned how to bake with the limited facilities we had at Base, so I could bring my own cookies to her feasts. I came to revel in standing on a creaky front porch beneath a bug lamp, sipping grape juice as I joined Minnie in yet another awful rendition of “Anatevka.” Occasionally I glanced at the big blue cradle of civilization hanging in the sky, remembered for the fiftieth or sixtieth or one hundredth time that none of this had any right to be happening, and reminded myself for the fiftieth or sixtieth or one hundredth time that the only sane response was to continue carrying the tune. I came to think of Minnie and Earl as the real reason we were on the Moon, and I came to understand one of the major reasons we were all so bloody careful to keep it a secret—because the needy masses of Earth, who were at that point still agitating about all the time and money spent on the space program, would not have been mollified by the knowledge that all those billions were being spent, in part, so that a few of the best and the brightest could indulge themselves in sing-alongs and wiener dog cookouts.</td>

<td>Janice awoke to the biggest surprise of her life: the sight of her two new legs, long, muscular, and fully functional. She was startled the first time she stood up: she was taller than she expected. Balancing at such a height without the use of her arms was unnerving, and simultaneously feeling the texture of the ground through the soles of her feet made it positively bizarre. Rescue workers, finding her wandering down the street dazedly, thought she was in shock until she—marveling at her ability to face them at eye level—explained to them what had happened. When statistics were gathered for the visitation, the restoration of Janice’s legs was recorded as a blessing, and she was humbly grateful for her good fortune. It was at the first of the support group meetings that a feeling of guilt began to creep in. There Janice met two individuals with cancer who’d witnessed Rashiel’s visitation, thought their cure was at hand, and been bitterly disappointed when they realized they’d been passed over. Janice found herself wondering, why had she received a blessing when they had not? Janice’s family and friends considered the restoration of her legs a reward for excelling at the task God had set for her, but for Janice, this interpretation raised another question. Did He intend for her to stop? Surely not; evangelism provided the central direction of her life, and there was no limit to the number of people who needed to hear her message. Her continuing to preach was the best action she could take, both for herself and for others. Her reservations grew during her first speaking engagement after the visitation, before an audience of people recently paralyzed and now wheelchair-bound. Janice delivered her usual words of inspiration, assuring them that they had the strength needed for the challenges ahead; it was during the Q&amp;A that she was asked if the restoration of her legs meant she had passed her test. Janice didn’t know what to say; she could hardly promise them that one day their marks would be erased. In fact, she realized, any implication that she’d been rewarded could be interpreted as criticism of others who remained afflicted, and she didn’t want that. All she could tell them was that she didn’t know why she’d been cured, but it was obvious </td>

These were people who, when they died, descended to Hell in proud defiance of God. Neil himself had read a pamphlet of the humanist movement; what he most remembered was that it had quoted the fallen angels. Visitations of fallen angels were infrequent, and caused neither good fortune nor bad; they weren’t acting under God’s direction, but just passing through the mortal plane as they went about their unimaginable business. On the occasions they appeared, people would ask them questions: did they know God’s intentions? Why had they rebelled? The fallen angels’ reply was always the same: Decide for yourselves. That is what we did. We advise you to do the same. Those in the humanist movement had decided, and if it weren’t for Sarah, Neil would’ve made the identical choice.

Equations?” “Like, maybe radio,” Axel said. “Or whatever you’ve got that’s faster, like micro-tachy-tot waves, or super-hydro-electro-neutrinos.” “One moment,” said Reggie. “At what frequency?” “Frequency? Just once is okay.” He rubbed a little spot just under his jaw. A machine, even one as sophisticated as this Reggiesystems model, is not given to sighing, though one might imagine this model had many occasions to do so. What Reggie did was increase his pauses and slow down his speech delivery. “</td>

We lost five separate people while I was there; two to blowouts, one to a collapsing crane, one to a careless tumble off a crater rim, and one to suicide (she, alas, had not been to Minnie and Earl’s yet). We had injuries every week, shortages every day, and crises just about every hour. Most of the time, we seemed to lose ground—and even when we didn’t, we lived with the knowledge that all of our work and all of our dedication could be thrown in the toilet the first time there was a political shift back home. There was no reason for any of us to believe that we were actually accomplishing what we were there to do—but somehow, with Minnie and Earl there, hosting a different group every night, it was impossible to come to any other conclusion. They liked us. They believed in us. They were sure that we were worth their time and effort. And they expected us to be around for a long, long time . . . just like they had been. I suppose that’s another reason why I was so determined to find them now. Because I didn’t know what it said about the people we’d become that they weren’t around keeping us company anymore.</td>

<td>While staying with the Asonu I met a man from the Candensian plane, which is very much like ours, only more of it consists of Toronto. He told me that in order to change planes all a Candensian has to do is eat two dill pickles, tighten his belt, sit upright in a hard chair with his back not touching the back, and breathe ten times a minute for about ten minutes. This is enviably easy, compared to our technique. We (I mean people from the plane I occupy when not traveling) seem unable to change planes except at airports. The Interplanary Agency long ago established that a specific combination of tense misery, indigestion, and boredom is the essential facilitator of interplanary travel; but most people, from most planes, don’t have to suffer the way we do.</td>

The one that Neil traveled to was in a desert, an expanse of cracked mud reaching miles in every direction; it was desolate, but it was relatively accessible and thus popular among pilgrims. The appearance of the holy site was an object lesson in what happened when the celestial and terrestrial realms touched: the landscape was variously scarred by lava flows, gaping fissures, and impact craters. Vegetation was scarce and ephemeral, restricted to growing in the interval after soil was deposited by floodwaters or whirlwinds and before it was scoured away again.</td>

<td>Rotomotoman, back in motion again, had rolled out to the center of the room. The saurs were gathered around him in a circle. Tom could hear a faint mechanical buzzing and a high-pitched beep come from the metal cylinder. At the same moment, a section of the odd little robot, defined by nearly imperceptible seams in his cylindrical torso, slid out like the drawer of a desk. Tom couldn’t see what was inside, but he knew what it was. Bronte was the closest to the drawer, peering in with sad, hopeful eyes. Then she opened her mouth as if to gasp. She spoke to the others and they all moved in even closer, trying to get a peek inside. Tom couldn’t hear a word of it, but he didn’t have to. Axel, perched on Hubert’s back to stare into the little drawer, shouted out, “It moved! I saw it move!” Tom went back to the bench. His coming in now would just create more nervous commotion and probably start Agnes shouting again. There would be plenty of time later to consider all the implications. The investigators, back-tracking through their information, might request a look at the schematics of Axel’s metal friend and discover Rotomotoman’s very practical function as an incubator. But then, Reggie may have anticipated that too, and devised a little camouflage for it. Never underestimate the Reggiesystem, Tom learned long ago. After all, Reggie too was a kind of human-made life form, and like the saurs had developed in his own way.

The assorted trials he faced growing up were accidental or human in origin, and he relied on strictly human resources to counter them. He became an adult who—like so many others—viewed God’s actions in the abstract until they impinged upon his own life. Angelic visitations were events that befell other people, reaching him only via reports on the nightly news. His own life was entirely mundane; he worked as a superintendent for an upscale apartment building, collecting rent and performing repairs, and as far as he was concerned, circumstances were fully capable of unfolding, happily or not, without intervention from above. This remained his experience until the death of his wife. It was an unexceptional visitation, smaller in magnitude than most but no different in kind, bringing blessings to some and disaster to others. In this instance the angel was Nathanael, making an appearance in a downtown shopping district. Four miracle cures were effected: the elimination of carcinomas in two individuals, the regeneration of the spinal cord in a paraplegic, and the restoration of sight to a recently blinded person. There were also two miracles that were not cures: a delivery van, whose driver had fainted at the sight of the angel, was halted before it could overrun a busy sidewalk; another man was caught in a shaft of Heaven’s light when the angel departed, erasing his eyes but ensuring his devotion. Neil’s wife Sarah Fisk had been one of the eight casualties. She was hit by flying glass when the angel’s billowing curtain of flame shattered the storefront window of the café in which she was eating.

<td>Then there was a flash of light and Janice was knocked off her feet as if she’d been struck by a sledgehammer. At first he thought she’d been hit by lightning, but then he realized that the lightning had already ceased. It was when she stood up again that he saw her face, steam rising from newly featureless skin, and he realized that Janice had been struck by Heaven’s light. Neil looked up, but all he saw were clouds; the shaft of light was gone. It seemed as if God were taunting him, not only by showing him the prize he’d lost his life trying to acquire while still holding it out of reach, but also by giving it to someone who didn’t need it or even want it. God had already wasted a miracle on Janice, and now He was doing it again. It was at that moment that another beam of Heaven’s light penetrated the cloud cover and struck Neil, trapped in his vehicle. Like a thousand hypodermic needles the light punctured his flesh and scraped across his bones. The light unmade his eyes, turning him into not a formerly sighted being, but a being never intended to possess vision. And in doing so the light revealed to Neil all the reasons he should love God. He loved Him with an utterness beyond what humans can experience for one another. To say it was unconditional was inadequate, because even the word “unconditional” required the concept of a condition and such an idea was no longer comprehensible to him: every phenomenon in the universe was nothing less than an explicit reason to love Him. No circumstance could be an obstacle or even an irrelevancy, but only another reason to be grateful, a further inducement to love. Neil thought of the grief that had driven him to suicidal recklessness, and the pain and terror that Sarah had experienced before she died, and still he loved God, not in spite of their suffering, but because of it. He renounced all his previous anger and ambivalence and desire for answers. He was grateful for all the pain he’d endured, contrite for not previously recognizing it as the gift it was, euphoric that he was now being granted this insight into his true purpose. He understood how life was an undeserved bounty, how even the most virtuous were not worthy of the glories of the mortal plane. For him the mystery was solved, because he understood that everything in life is love, even pain, especially pain. So minutes later, when Neil finally bled to death, he was truly worthy of salvation. And God sent him to Hell anyway.</td>

Despite my current panic, I have to smile at the sight of her. She is so intent, her eyes roving over her own screen as she continues working. When she is enraptured in her archaeology like this, she suddenly looks eighteen again. There is that huntress-fierceness to her stare. I am so proud of her and all that she is. She nods her agreement. I know she is busy, but this is important. Still, I procrastinate. I love to see her like this. Soon enough I will have to shatter her ardent focus. “Do you ever miss actually handling the beads and the artifacts?” “Oh. Well, yes, I do. But this is still good. And the native peoples have been much more receptive to our work now that they know all the grave goods will remain in situ and relatively undisturbed. The cameras and the chem scanners can do most of the data gathering for us. But it still takes a human mind to put it all together and figure out what it means. And this way of doing it is better, both for archaeology and anthropology. Sometimes we’re too trapped in our own time to see what it all means. Sometimes we’re too close, temporally, to understand the culture we’re investigating. By leaving all the artifacts and bones in situ, we make it possible for later anthropologists to take a fresh look at it, with unprejudiced eyes.” She glances up at me and our eyes meet. “So. You called?” “Patsy,” I say. She</td>

<td>Damon was quick to express his opinions, and his opinions, right or wrong, were one of the forces that drove science fiction toward maturity of vision and integrity of craft. His reviews, collected in In Search of Wonder, along with James Blish’s in The Issue at Hand, were major influences on the writers of their time. Damon wasn’t always right, but he was always forceful and his force was toward higher aspirations and greater achievements. For instance, he never understood Van Vogt’s strengths (or if he did he never acknowledged them). But when I was planning a series of academic editions for the Perennial Library, I had the inspiration of asking Damon to do an introduction to The World of Null-A, as a kind of reappraisal, and Damon agreed. But Perennial canceled the series before anything was written.</td>

I got up and went out to take the air and see the city of Slas on the Islac plane. It might have been a big city on my plane, nothing exotic to my eye, except the buildings were more mixed in style and in size than ours. That is, we put the big imposing buildings at the center and on the nice streets, and the small humble ones in the neighborhoods or barrios or slums or shantytowns. In this residential quarter of Slas, big houses were all jumbled up together with tiny cottages, some of them hardly bigger than hutches. When I went the other direction, downtown, I found the same wild variation of scale in the office buildings. A massive old four-story granite block towered over a ten-story building ten feet wide, with floors only five or six feet apart—a doll’s skyscraper. By then, however, enough Islai were out and about that the buildings didn’t puzzle me as much as the people did.</td>

Swann, quoique beaucoup plus jeune que lui,<br/>était très lié avec mon grand-père qui avait été un des meilleurs amis<br/>de son père, homme excellent mais singulier, chez qui, paraît-il, un<br/>rien suffisait parfois pour interrompre les élans du cœur, changer le<br/>cours de la pensée. J’entendais plusieurs fois par an mon grand-père<br/>raconter à table des anecdotes toujours les mêmes sur l’attitude<br/>qu’avait eue M. Swann le père, à la mort de sa femme qu’il avait<br/>veillée jour et nuit. Mon grand-père qui ne l’avait pas vu depuis<br/>longtemps était accouru auprès de lui dans la propriété que les Swann<br/>possédaient aux environs de Combray, et avait réussi, pour qu’il<br/>n’assistât pas à la mise en bière, à lui faire quitter un moment, tout<br/>en pleurs, la chambre mortuaire. Ils firent quelques pas dans le parc<br/>où il y avait un peu de soleil. Tout d’un coup, M. Swann prenant mon<br/>grand-père par le bras, s’était écrié: «Ah! mon vieil ami, quel<br/>bonheur de se promener ensemble par ce beau temps. Vous ne trouvez pas<br/>ça joli tous ces arbres, ces aubépines et mon étang dont vous ne<br/>m’avez jamais félicité? Vous avez l’air comme un bonnet de nuit.<br/>Sentez-vous ce petit vent? Ah! on a beau dire, la vie a du bon tout de<br/>même, mon cher Amédée!» Brusquement le souvenir de sa femme morte lui<br/>revint, et trouvant sans doute trop compliqué de chercher comment il<br/>avait pu à un pareil moment se laisser aller à un mouvement de joie,<br/>il se contenta, par un geste qui lui était familier chaque fois qu’une<br/>question ardue se présentait à son esprit, de passer la main sur son<br/>front, d’essuyer ses yeux et les verres de son lorgnon. Il ne put<br/>pourtant pas se consoler de la mort de sa femme, mais pendant les deux<br/>années qu’il lui survécut, il disait à mon grand-père: «C’est drôle,<br/>je pense très souvent à ma pauvre femme, mais je ne peux y penser<br/>beaucoup à la fois.» «Souvent, mais peu à la fois, comme le pauvre<br/>père Swann», était devenu une des phrases favorites de mon grand-père<br/>qui la prononçait à propos des choses les plus différentes. Il<br/>m’aurait paru que ce père de Swann était un monstre, si mon grand-père<br/>que je considérais comme meilleur juge et dont la sentence faisant<br/>jurisprudence pour moi, m’a souvent servi dans la suite à absoudre des<br/>fautes que j’aurais été enclin à condamner, ne s’était récrié: «Mais<br/>comment? c’était un cœur d’or!»<br/><br/></td>

Si l’on avait voulu à toute force appliquer à Swann un<br/>coefficient social qui lui fût personnel, entre les autres fils<br/>d’agents de situation égale à celle de ses parents, ce coefficient eût<br/>été pour lui un peu inférieur parce que, très simple de façon et ayant<br/>toujours eu une «toquade» d’objets anciens et de peinture, il<br/>demeurait maintenant dans un vieil hôtel où il entassait ses<br/>collections et que ma grand’mère rêvait de visiter, mais qui était<br/>situé quai d’Orléans, quartier que ma grand’tante trouvait infamant<br/>d’habiter. «Êtes-vous seulement connaisseur? je vous demande cela dans<br/>votre intérêt, parce que vous devez vous faire repasser des croûtes<br/>par les marchands», lui disait ma grand’tante; elle ne lui supposait<br/>en effet aucune compétence et n’avait pas haute idée même au point de<br/>vue intellectuel d’un homme qui dans la conversation évitait les<br/>sujets sérieux et montrait une précision fort prosaïque non seulement<br/>quand il nous donnait, en entrant dans les moindres détails, des<br/>recettes de cuisine, mais même quand les sœurs de ma grand’mère<br/>parlaient de sujets artistiques. Provoqué par elles à donner son avis,<br/>à exprimer son admiration pour un tableau, il gardait un silence<br/>presque désobligeant et se rattrapait en revanche s’il pouvait fournir<br/>sur le musée où il se trouvait, sur la date où il avait été peint, un<br/>renseignement matériel. Mais d’habitude il se contentait de chercher à<br/>nous amuser en racontant chaque fois une histoire nouvelle qui venait<br/>de lui arriver avec des gens choisis parmi ceux que nous connaissions,<br/>avec le pharmacien de Combray, avec notre cuisinière, avec notre<br/>cocher. Certes ces récits faisaient rire ma grand’tante, mais sans<br/>qu’elle distinguât bien si c’était à cause du rôle ridicule que s’y<br/>donnait toujours Swann ou de l’esprit qu’il mettait à les conter: «On<br/>peut dire que vous êtes un vrai type, monsieur Swann!» Comme elle<br/>était la seule personne un peu vulgaire de notre famille, elle avait<br/>soin de faire remarquer aux étrangers, quand on parlait de Swann,<br/>qu’il aurait pu, s’il avait voulu, habiter boulevard Haussmann ou<br/>avenue de l’Opéra, qu’il était le fils de M. Swann qui avait dû lui<br/>laisser quatre ou cinq millions, mais que c’était sa fantaisie.<br/>Fantaisie qu’elle jugeait du reste devoir être si divertissante pour<br/>les autres, qu’à Paris, quand M. Swann venait le 1er janvier lui<br/>apporter son sac de marrons glacés, elle ne manquait pas, s’il y avait<br/>du monde, de lui dire: «Eh bien! M. Swann, vous habitez toujours près<br/>de l’Entrepôt des vins, pour être sûr de ne pas manquer le train quand<br/>vous prenez le chemin de Lyon?» Et elle regardait du coin de l’œil,<br/>par-dessus son lorgnon, les autres visiteurs.</td>

<td>), la marquise de<br/>Villeparisis, de la célèbre famille de Bouillon, celle-ci lui avait<br/>dit: «Je crois que vous connaissez beaucoup M. Swann qui est un grand<br/>ami de mes neveux des Laumes». Ma grand’mère était revenue de sa<br/>visite enthousiasmée par la maison qui donnait sur des jardins et où<br/>Mme  de Villeparisis lui conseillait de louer, et aussi par un giletier<br/>et sa fille, qui avaient leur boutique dans la cour et chez qui elle<br/>était entrée demander qu’on fît un point à sa jupe qu’elle avait<br/>déchirée dans l’escalier. Ma grand’mère avait trouvé ces gens<br/>parfaits, elle déclarait que la petite était une perle et que le<br/>giletier était l’homme le plus distingué, le mieux qu’elle eût jamais<br/>vu. Car pour elle, la distinction était quelque chose d’absolument<br/>indépendant du rang social. Elle s’extasiait sur une réponse que le<br/>giletier lui avait faite, disant à maman: «Sévigné n’aurait pas mieux<br/>dit!» et en revanche, d’un neveu de Mme  de Villeparisis qu’elle avait<br/>rencontré chez elle: «Ah! ma fille, comme il est commun!»<br/><br/><br/>Or le propos relatif à Swann avait eu pour effet non pas de relever<br/>celui-ci dans l’esprit de ma grand’tante, mais d’y abaisser Mme  de<br/>Villeparisis. Il semblait que la considération que, sur la foi de ma<br/>grand’mère, nous accordions à Mme  de Villeparisis, lui créât un devoir<br/>de ne rien faire qui l’en rendît moins digne et auquel elle avait<br/>manqué en apprenant l’existence de Swann, en permettant à des parents<br/>à elle de le fréquenter. «Comment elle connaît Swann? Pour une<br/>personne que tu prétendais parente du maréchal de Mac-Mahon!» Cette<br/>opinion de mes parents sur les relations de Swann leur parut ensuite<br/>confirmée par son mariage avec une femme de la pire société, presque<br/>une cocotte que, d’ailleurs, il ne chercha jamais à présenter,<br/>continuant à venir seul chez nous, quoique de moins en moins, mais<br/>d’après laquelle ils crurent pouvoir juger—supposant que c’était là<br/>qu’il l’avait prise—le milieu, inconnu d’eux, qu’il fréquentait<br/>habituellement.<br/><br/><br/>Mais une fois, mon grand-père lut dans un journal que M. Swann était<br/>un des plus fidèles habitués des déjeuners du dimanche chez le duc de<br/>X..., dont le père et l’oncle avaient été les hommes d’État les plus<br/>en vue du règne de Louis-Philippe. Or mon grand-père était curieux de<br/>tous les petits faits qui pouvaient l’aider à entrer par la pensée<br/>dans la vie privée d’hommes comme Molé, comme le duc Pasquier, comme<br/>le duc de Broglie. Il fut enchanté d’apprendre que Swann fréquentait<br/>des gens qui les avaient connus. Ma grand’tante au contraire<br/>interpréta cette nouvelle dans un sens défavorable à Swann: quelqu’un<br/>qui choisissait ses fréquentations en dehors de la caste où il était<br/>né, en dehors de sa «classe» sociale, subissait à ses yeux un fâcheux<br/>déclassement. Il lui semblait qu’on renonçât d’un coup au fruit de<br/>toutes les belles relations avec des gens bien posés, qu’avaient<br/>honorablement entretenues et engrangées pour leurs enfants les<br/>familles prévoyantes; (ma grand’tante avait même cessé de voir le fils<br/>d’un notaire de nos amis parce qu’il avait épousé une altesse et était<br/>par là descendu pour elle du rang respecté de fils de notaire à celui<br/>d’un de ces aventuriers, anciens valets de chambre ou garçons<br/>d’écurie, pour qui on raconte que les reines eurent parfois des<br/>bontés).</td>

<td>Je relisais ce matin dans<br/>Saint-Simon quelque chose qui vous aurait amusé. C’est dans le volume<br/>sur son ambassade d’Espagne; ce n’est pas un des meilleurs, ce n’est<br/>guère qu’un journal, mais du moins un journal merveilleusement écrit,<br/>ce qui fait déjà une première différence avec les assommants journaux<br/>que nous nous croyons obligés de lire matin et soir.» «Je ne suis pas<br/>de votre avis, il y a des jours où la lecture des journaux me semble<br/>fort agréable...», interrompit ma tante Flora, pour montrer qu’elle<br/>avait lu la phrase sur le Corot de Swann dans le Figaro. «Quand ils<br/>parlent de choses ou de gens qui nous intéressent!» enchérit ma tante<br/>Céline. «Je ne dis pas non, répondit Swann étonné. Ce que je reproche<br/>aux journaux c’est de nous faire faire attention tous les jours à des<br/>choses insignifiantes tandis que nous lisons trois ou quatre fois dans<br/>notre vie les livres où il y a des choses essentielles. Du moment que<br/>nous déchirons fiévreusement chaque matin la bande du journal, alors<br/>on devrait changer les choses et mettre dans le journal, moi je ne<br/>sais pas, les... Pensées de Pascal! (il détacha ce mot d’un ton<br/>d’emphase ironique pour ne pas avoir l’air pédant). Et c’est dans le<br/>volume doré sur tranches que nous n’ouvrons qu’une fois tous les dix<br/>ans, ajouta-t-il en témoignant pour les choses mondaines ce dédain<br/>qu’affectent certains hommes du monde, que nous lirions que la reine<br/>de Grèce est allée à Cannes ou que la princesse de Léon a donné un bal<br/>costumé. Comme cela la juste proportion serait rétablie.» Mais<br/>regrettant de s’être laissé aller à parler même légèrement de choses<br/>sérieuses: «Nous avons une bien belle conversation, dit-il<br/>ironiquement, je ne sais pas pourquoi nous abordons ces «sommets», et<br/>se tournant vers mon grand-père: «Donc Saint-Simon raconte que<br/>Maulevrier avait eu l’audace de tendre la main à ses fils. Vous savez,<br/>c’est ce Maulevrier dont il dit: «Jamais je ne vis dans cette épaisse<br/>bouteille que de l’humeur, de la grossièreté et des sottises.»<br/>«Épaisses ou non, je connais des bouteilles où il y a tout autre<br/>chose», dit vivement Flora, qui tenait à avoir remercié Swann elle<br/>aussi, car le présent de vin d’Asti s’adressait aux deux. Céline se<br/>mit à rire. Swann interloqué reprit: «Je ne sais si ce fut ignorance<br/>ou panneau, écrit Saint-Simon, il voulut donner la main à mes enfants.<br/>Je m’en aperçus assez tôt pour l’en empêcher.» Mon grand-père<br/>s’extasiait déjà sur «ignorance ou panneau», mais Mlle  Céline, chez<br/>qui le nom de Saint-Simon,—un littérateur,—avait empêché l’anesthésie<br/>complète des facultés auditives, s’indignait déjà: «Comment? vous<br/>admirez cela? Eh bien! c’est du joli! Mais qu’est-ce que cela peut<br/>vouloir dire; est-ce qu’un homme n’est pas autant qu’un autre?<br/>Qu’est-ce que cela peut faire qu’il soit duc ou cocher s’il a de<br/>l’intelligence et du cœur? Il avait une belle manière d’élever ses<br/>enfants, votre Saint-Simon, s’il ne leur disait pas de donner la main<br/>à tous les honnêtes gens. Mais c’est abominable, tout simplement. Et<br/>vous osez citer cela?» Et mon grand-père navré, sentant<br/>l’impossibilité, devant cette obstruction, de chercher à faire<br/>raconter à Swann, les histoires qui l’eussent amusé disait à voix<br/>basse à maman: «Rappelle-moi donc le vers que tu m’as appris et qui me<br/>soulage tant dans ces moments-là.

<td>Mon effroi était que Françoise, la cuisinière de<br/>ma tante qui était chargée de s’occuper de moi quand j’étais à<br/>Combray, refusât de porter mon mot. Je me doutais que pour elle, faire<br/>une commission à ma mère quand il y avait du monde lui paraîtrait<br/>aussi impossible que pour le portier d’un théâtre de remettre une<br/>lettre à un acteur pendant qu’il est en scène. Elle possédait à<br/>l’égard des choses qui peuvent ou ne peuvent pas se faire un code<br/>impérieux, abondant, subtil et intransigeant sur des distinctions<br/>insaisissables ou oiseuses (ce qui lui donnait l’apparence de ces lois<br/>antiques qui, à côté de prescriptions féroces comme de massacrer les<br/>enfants à la mamelle, défendent avec une délicatesse exagérée de faire<br/>bouillir le chevreau dans le lait de sa mère, ou de manger dans un<br/>animal le nerf de la cuisse). Ce code, si l’on en jugeait par<br/>l’entêtement soudain qu’elle mettait à ne pas vouloir faire certaines<br/>commissions que nous lui donnions, semblait avoir prévu des<br/>complexités sociales et des raffinements mondains tels que rien dans<br/>l’entourage de Françoise et dans sa vie de domestique de village<br/>n’avait pu les lui suggérer; et l’on était obligé de se dire qu’il y<br/>avait en elle un passé français très ancien, noble et mal compris,<br/>comme dans ces cités manufacturières où de vieux hôtels témoignent<br/>qu’il y eut jadis une vie de cour, et où les ouvriers d’une usine de<br/>produits chimiques travaillent au milieu de délicates sculptures qui<br/>représentent le miracle de saint Théophile ou les quatre fils Aymon.<br/>Dans le cas particulier, l’article du code à cause duquel il était peu<br/>probable que sauf le cas d’incendie Françoise allât déranger maman en<br/>présence de M. Swann pour un aussi petit personnage que moi, exprimait<br/>simplement le respect qu’elle professait non seulement pour les<br/>parents,—comme pour les morts, les prêtres et les rois,—mais encore<br/>pour l’étranger à qui on donne l’hospitalité, respect qui m’aurait<br/>peut-être touché dans un livre mais qui m’irritait toujours dans sa<br/>bouche, à cause du ton grave et attendri qu’elle prenait pour en<br/>parler, et davantage ce soir où le caractère sacré qu’elle conférait<br/>au dîner avait pour effet qu’elle refuserait d’en troubler la<br/>cérémonie. Mais pour mettre une chance de mon côté, je n’hésitai pas à<br/>mentir et à lui dire que ce n’était pas du tout moi qui avais voulu<br/>écrire à maman, mais que c’était maman qui, en me quittant, m’avait<br/>recommandé de ne pas oublier de lui envoyer une réponse relativement à<br/>un objet qu’elle m’avait prié de chercher; et elle serait certainement<br/>très fâchée si on ne lui remettait pas ce mot. Je pense que Françoise<br/>ne me crut pas, car, comme les hommes primitifs dont les sens étaient<br/>plus puissants que les nôtres, elle discernait immédiatement, à des<br/>signes insaisissables pour nous, toute vérité que nous voulions lui<br/>cacher; elle regarda pendant cinq minutes l’enveloppe comme si<br/>l’examen du papier et l’aspect de l’écriture allaient la renseigner<br/>sur la nature du contenu ou lui apprendre à quel article de son code<br/>elle devait se référer. Puis elle sortit d’un air résigné qui semblait<br/>signifier: «C’est-il pas malheureux pour des parents d’avoir un enfant<br/>pareil!» Elle revint au bout d’un moment me dire qu’on n’en était<br/>encore qu’à la glace, qu’il était impossible au maître d’hôtel de<br/>remettre la lettre en ce moment devant tout le monde, mais que, quand<br/>on serait aux rince-bouche, on trouverait le moyen de la faire passer<br/>à maman. </td>

Mon père me refusait constamment des<br/>permissions qui m’avaient été consenties dans les pactes plus larges<br/>octroyés par ma mère et ma grand’mère parce qu’il ne se souciait pas<br/>des «principes» et qu’il n’y avait pas avec lui de «Droit des gens».<br/>Pour une raison toute contingente, ou même sans raison, il me<br/>supprimait au dernier moment telle promenade si habituelle, si<br/>consacrée, qu’on ne pouvait m’en priver sans parjure, ou bien, comme<br/>il avait encore fait ce soir, longtemps avant l’heure rituelle, il me<br/>disait: «Allons, monte te coucher, pas d’explication!» Mais aussi,<br/>parce qu’il n’avait pas de principes (dans le sens de ma grand’mère),<br/>il n’avait pas à proprement parler d’intransigeance. Il me regarda un<br/>instant d’un air étonné et fâché, puis dès que maman lui eut expliqué<br/>en quelques mots embarrassés ce qui était arrivé, il lui dit: «Mais va<br/>donc avec lui, puisque tu disais justement que tu n’as pas envie de<br/>dormir, reste un peu dans sa chambre, moi je n’ai besoin de rien.»<br/>«Mais, mon ami, répondit timidement ma mère, que j’aie envie ou non de<br/>dormir, ne change rien à la chose, on ne peut pas habituer cet<br/>enfant...» «Mais il ne s’agit pas d’habituer, dit mon père en haussant<br/>les épaules, tu vois bien que ce petit a du chagrin, il a l’air<br/>désolé, cet enfant; voyons, nous ne sommes pas des bourreaux!

Même à l’heure où elle se<br/>manifestait par cette grâce, la conduite de mon père à mon égard<br/>gardait ce quelque chose d’arbitraire et d’immérité qui la<br/>caractérisait et qui tenait à ce que généralement elle résultait<br/>plutôt de convenances fortuites que d’un plan prémédité. Peut-être<br/>même que ce que j’appelais sa sévérité, quand il m’envoyait me<br/>coucher, méritait moins ce nom que celle de ma mère ou ma grand’mère,<br/>car sa nature, plus différente en certains points de la mienne que<br/>n’était la leur, n’avait probablement pas deviné jusqu’ici combien<br/>j’étais malheureux tous les soirs, ce que ma mère et ma grand’mère<br/>savaient bien; mais elles m’aimaient assez pour ne pas consentir à<br/>m’épargner de la souffrance, elles voulaient m’apprendre à la dominer<br/>afin de diminuer ma sensibilité nerveuse et fortifier ma volonté. Pour<br/>mon père, dont l’affection pour moi était d’une autre sorte, je ne<br/>sais pas s’il aurait eu ce courage: pour une fois où il venait de<br/>comprendre que j’avais du chagrin, il avait dit à ma mère: «Va donc le<br/>consoler.» Maman resta cette nuit-là dans ma chambre et, comme pour ne<br/>gâter d’aucun remords ces heures si différentes de ce que j’avais eu<br/>le droit d’espérer, quand Françoise, comprenant qu’il se passait<br/>quelque chose d’extraordinaire en voyant maman assise près de moi, qui<br/>me tenait la main et me laissait pleurer sans me gronder, lui demanda:<br/>«Mais Madame, qu’a donc Monsieur à pleurer ainsi?» maman lui répondit:<br/>«Mais il ne sait pas lui-même, Françoise, il est énervé; préparez-moi<br/>vite le grand lit et montez vous coucher.» Ainsi, pour la première<br/>fois, ma tristesse n’était plus considérée comme une faute punissable<br/>mais comme un mal involontaire qu’on venait de reconnaître<br/>officiellement, comme un état nerveux dont je n’étais pas responsable;<br/>j’avais le soulagement de n’avoir plus à mêler de scrupules à<br/>l’amertume de mes larmes, je pouvais pleurer sans péché. Je n’étais<br/>pas non plus médiocrement fier vis-à-vis de Françoise de ce retour des<br/>choses humaines, qui, une heure après que maman avait refusé de monter<br/>dans ma chambre et m’avait fait dédaigneusement répondre que je<br/>devrais dormir, m’élevait à la dignité de grande personne et m’avait<br/>fait atteindre tout d’un coup à une sorte de puberté du chagrin,<br/>d’émancipation des larmes. J’aurais dû être heureux: je ne l’étais<br/>pas. Il me semblait que ma mère venait de me faire une première<br/>concession qui devait lui être douloureuse, que c’était une première<br/>abdication de sa part devant l’idéal qu’elle avait conçu pour moi, et<br/>que pour la première fois, elle, si courageuse, s’avouait vaincue. Il<br/>me semblait que si je venais de remporter une victoire c’était contre<br/>elle, que j’avais réussi comme auraient pu faire la maladie, des<br/>chagrins, ou l’âge, à détendre sa volonté, à faire fléchir sa raison<br/>et que cette soirée commençait une ère, resterait comme une triste<br/>date. Si j’avais osé maintenant, j’aurais dit à maman: «Non je ne veux<br/>pas, ne couche pas ici.» Mais je connaissais la sagesse pratique,<br/>réaliste comme on dirait aujourd’hui, qui tempérait en elle la nature<br/>ardemment idéaliste de ma grand’mère, et je savais que, maintenant que<br/>le mal était fait, elle aimerait mieux m’en laisser du moins goûter le<br/>plaisir calmant et ne pas déranger mon père. Certes, le beau visage de<br/>ma mère brillait encore de jeunesse ce soir-là où elle me tenait si<br/>doucement les mains et cherchait à arrêter mes larmes; mais justement<br/>il me semblait que cela n’aurait pas dû être, sa colère eût été moins<br/>triste pour moi que cette douceur nouvelle que n’avait pas connue mon<br/>enfance; il me semblait que je venais d’une main impie et secrète de<br/>tracer dans son âme une première ride et d’y faire apparaître un<br/>premier cheveu blanc. Cette pensée redoubla mes sanglots et alors je<br/>vis maman, qui jamais ne se laissait aller à aucun attendrissement<br/>avec moi, être tout d’un coup gagnée par le mien et essayer de retenir<br/>une envie de pleurer. Comme elle sentit que je m’en étais aperçu, elle<br/>me dit en riant: «Voilà mon petit jaunet, mon petit serin, qui va<br/>rendre sa maman aussi bêtasse que lui, pour peu que cela continue.<br/>Voyons, puisque tu n’as pas sommeil ni ta maman non plus, ne restons<br/>pas à nous énerver, faisons quelque chose, prenons un de tes livres.»</td>

Elle demandait à Swann si l’œuvre n’avait pas été<br/>gravée, préférant, quand c’était possible, des gravures anciennes et<br/>ayant encore un intérêt au delà d’elles-mêmes, par exemple celles qui<br/>représentent un chef-d’œuvre dans un état où nous ne pouvons plus le<br/>voir aujourd’hui (comme la gravure de la Cène de Léonard avant sa<br/>dégradation, par Morgan). Il faut dire que les résultats de cette<br/>manière de comprendre l’art de faire un cadeau ne furent pas toujours<br/>très brillants. L’idée que je pris de Venise d’après un dessin du<br/>Titien qui est censé avoir pour fond la lagune, était certainement<br/>beaucoup moins exacte que celle que m’eussent donnée de simples<br/>photographies. On ne pouvait plus faire le compte à la maison, quand<br/>ma grand’tante voulait dresser un réquisitoire contre ma grand’mère,<br/>des fauteuils offerts par elle à de jeunes fiancés ou à de vieux<br/>époux, qui, à la première tentative qu’on avait faite pour s’en<br/>servir, s’étaient immédiatement effondrés sous le poids d’un des<br/>destinataires. Mais ma grand’mère aurait cru mesquin de trop s’occuper<br/>de la solidité d’une boiserie où se distinguaient encore une<br/>fleurette, un sourire, quelquefois une belle imagination du passé.<br/>Même ce qui dans ces meubles répondait à un besoin, comme c’était<br/>d’une façon à laquelle nous ne sommes plus habitués, la charmait comme<br/>les vieilles manières de dire où nous voyons une métaphore, effacée,<br/>dans notre moderne langage, par l’usure de l’habitude. Or, justement,<br/>les romans champêtres de George Sand qu’elle me donnait pour ma fête,<br/>étaient pleins ainsi qu’un mobilier ancien, d’expressions tombées en<br/>désuétude et redevenues imagées, comme on n’en trouve plus qu’à la<br/>campagne. Et ma grand’mère les avait achetés de préférence à d’autres<br/>comme elle eût loué plus volontiers une propriété où il y aurait eu un<br/>pigeonnier gothique ou quelqu’une de ces vieilles choses qui exercent<br/>sur l’esprit une heureuse influence en lui donnant la nostalgie<br/>d’impossibles voyages dans le temps.</td>

Même dans la vie, quand c’étaient des êtres et non des<br/>œuvres d’art qui excitaient ainsi son attendrissement ou son<br/>admiration, c’était touchant de voir avec quelle déférence elle<br/>écartait de sa voix, de son geste, de ses propos, tel éclat de gaîté<br/>qui eût pu faire mal à cette mère qui avait autrefois perdu un enfant,<br/>tel rappel de fête, d’anniversaire, qui aurait pu faire penser ce<br/>vieillard à son grand âge, tel propos de ménage qui aurait paru<br/>fastidieux à ce jeune savant. De même, quand elle lisait la prose de<br/>George Sand, qui respire toujours cette bonté, cette distinction<br/>morale que maman avait appris de ma grand’mère à tenir pour<br/>supérieures à tout dans la vie, et que je ne devais lui apprendre que<br/>bien plus tard à ne pas tenir également pour supérieures à tout dans<br/>les livres, attentive à bannir de sa voix toute petitesse, toute<br/>affectation qui eût pu empêcher le flot puissant d’y être reçu, elle<br/>fournissait toute la tendresse naturelle, toute l’ample douceur<br/>qu’elles réclamaient à ces phrases qui semblaient écrites pour sa voix<br/>et qui pour ainsi dire tenaient tout entières dans le registre de sa<br/>sensibilité. Elle retrouvait pour les attaquer dans le ton qu’il faut,<br/>l’accent cordial qui leur préexiste et les dicta, mais que les mots<br/>n’indiquent pas; grâce à lui elle amortissait au passage toute crudité<br/>dans les temps des verbes, donnait à l’imparfait et au passé défini la<br/>douceur qu’il y a dans la bonté, la mélancolie qu’il y a dans la<br/>tendresse, dirigeait la phrase qui finissait vers celle qui allait<br/>commencer, tantôt pressant, tantôt ralentissant la marche des syllabes<br/>pour les faire entrer, quoique leurs quantités fussent différentes,<br/>dans un rythme uniforme, elle insufflait à cette prose si commune une<br/>sorte de vie sentimentale et continue.<br/><br/><br/>Mes remords étaient calmés, je me laissais aller à la douceur</td>

<td>pauvre Françoise, je regrette de vous avoir fait monter pour rien.»<br/><br/><br/>Mais ma tante savait bien que ce n’était pas pour rien qu’elle avait<br/>sonné Françoise, car, à Combray, une personne «qu’on ne connaissait<br/>point» était un être aussi peu croyable qu’un dieu de la mythologie,<br/>et de fait on ne se souvenait pas que, chaque fois que s’était<br/>produite, dans la rue de Saint-Esprit ou sur la place, une de ces<br/>apparitions stupéfiantes, des recherches bien conduites n’eussent pas<br/>fini par réduire le personnage fabuleux aux proportions d’une<br/>«personne qu’on connaissait», soit personnellement, soit<br/>abstraitement, dans son état civil, en tant qu’ayant tel degré de<br/>parenté avec des gens de Combray. C’était le fils de Mme  Sauton qui<br/>rentrait du service, la nièce de l’abbé Perdreau qui sortait de<br/>couvent, le frère du curé, percepteur à Châteaudun qui venait de<br/>prendre sa retraite ou qui était venu passer les fêtes. On avait eu en<br/>les apercevant l’émotion de croire qu’il y avait à Combray des gens<br/>qu’on ne connaissait point simplement parce qu’on ne les avait pas<br/>reconnus ou identifiés tout de suite. Et pourtant, longtemps à<br/>l’avance, Mme  Sauton et le curé avaient prévenu qu’ils attendaient<br/>leurs «voyageurs». Quand le soir, je montais, en rentrant, raconter<br/>notre promenade à ma tante, si j’avais l’imprudence de lui dire que<br/>nous avions rencontré près du Pont-Vieux, un homme que mon grand-père<br/>ne connaissait pas: «Un homme que grand-père ne connaissait point,<br/>s’écriait elle. Ah! je te crois bien!» Néanmoins un peu émue de cette<br/>nouvelle, elle voulait en avoir le cœur net, mon grand-père était<br/>mandé. «Qui donc est-ce que vous avez rencontré près du Pont-Vieux,<br/>mon oncle? un homme que vous ne connaissiez point?»—«Mais si,<br/>répondait mon grand-père, c’était Prosper le frère du jardinier de Mme<br/>Bouillebœuf.»—«Ah! bien», disait ma tante, tranquillisée et un peu<br/>rouge; haussant les épaules avec un sourire ironique, elle ajoutait:<br/>«Aussi il me disait que vous aviez rencontré un homme que vous ne<br/>connaissiez point!» Et on me recommandait d’être plus circonspect une<br/>autre fois et de ne plus agiter ainsi ma tante par des paroles<br/>irréfléchies. On connaissait tellement bien tout le monde, à Combray,<br/>bêtes et gens, que si ma tante avait vu par hasard passer un chien<br/>«qu’elle ne connaissait point», elle ne cessait d’y penser et de<br/>consacrer à ce fait incompréhensible ses talents d’induction et ses<br/>heures de liberté.<br/><br/><br/>—«Ce sera le chien de Mme  Sazerat», disait Françoise, sans grande<br/>conviction, mais dans un but d’apaisement et pour que ma tante ne se<br/>«fende pas la tête.»<br/><br/><br/>—«Comme si je ne connaissais pas le chien de Mme  Sazerat!» répondait<br/>ma tante dont l’esprit critique n’admettait pas si facilement un fait</td>

Elle<br/>était si grossière, si dénuée de beauté artistique et même d’élan<br/>religieux. Du dehors, comme le croisement des rues sur lequel elle<br/>donnait était en contre-bas, sa grossière muraille s’exhaussait d’un<br/>soubassement en moellons nullement polis, hérissés de cailloux, et qui<br/>n’avait rien de particulièrement ecclésiastique, les verrières<br/>semblaient percées à une hauteur excessive, et le tout avait plus<br/>l’air d’un mur de prison que d’église. Et certes, plus tard, quand je<br/>me rappelais toutes les glorieuses absides que j’ai vues, il ne me<br/>serait jamais venu à la pensée de rapprocher d’elles l’abside de<br/>Combray. Seulement, un jour, au détour d’une petite rue provinciale,<br/>j’aperçus, en face du croisement de trois ruelles, une muraille fruste<br/>et surélevée, avec des verrières percées en haut et offrant le même<br/>aspect asymétrique que l’abside de Combray. Alors je ne me suis pas<br/>demandé comme à Chartres ou à Reims avec quelle puissance y était<br/>exprimé le sentiment religieux, mais je me suis involontairement<br/>écrié: «L’Église!»<br/><br/><br/>L’église! Familière; mitoyenne, rue Saint-Hilaire, où était sa porte<br/>nord, de ses deux voisines, la pharmacie de M. Rapin et la maison de<br/>Mme  Loiseau, qu’elle touchait sans aucune séparation; simple citoyenne<br/>de Combray qui aurait pu avoir son numéro dans la rue si les rues de<br/>Combray avaient eu des numéros, et où il semble que le facteur aurait<br/>dû s’arrêter le matin quand il faisait sa distribution, avant d’entrer<br/>chez Mme  Loiseau et en sortant de chez M. Rapin, il y avait pourtant<br/>entre elle et tout ce qui n’était pas elle une démarcation que mon<br/>esprit n’a jamais pu arriver à franchir. Mme  Loiseau avait beau avoir<br/>à sa fenêtre des fuchsias, qui prenaient la mauvaise habitude de<br/>laisser leurs branches courir toujours partout tête baissée, et dont<br/>les fleurs n’avaient rien de plus pressé, quand elles étaient assez<br/>grandes, que d’aller rafraîchir leurs joues violettes et<br/>congestionnées contre la sombre façade de l’église, les fuchsias ne<br/>devenaient pas sacrés pour cela pour moi; entre les fleurs et la<br/>pierre noircie sur laquelle elles s’appuyaient, si mes yeux ne<br/>percevaient pas d’intervalle, mon esprit réservait un abîme.<br/><br/></td>

Legrandin eût une certaine réputation comme<br/>écrivain et nous fûmes très étonnés de voir qu’un musicien célèbre<br/>avait composé une mélodie sur des vers de lui), doués de plus de<br/>«facilité» que bien des peintres, ils s’imaginent que la vie qu’ils<br/>mènent n’est pas celle qui leur aurait convenu et apportent à leurs<br/>occupations positives soit une insouciance mêlée de fantaisie, soit<br/>une application soutenue et hautaine, méprisante, amère et<br/>consciencieuse. Grand, avec une belle tournure, un visage pensif et<br/>fin aux longues moustaches blondes, au regard bleu et désenchanté,<br/>d’une politesse raffinée, causeur comme nous n’en avions jamais<br/>entendu, il était aux yeux de ma famille qui le citait toujours en<br/>exemple, le type de l’homme d’élite, prenant la vie de la façon la<br/>plus noble et la plus délicate. Ma grand’mère lui reprochait seulement<br/>de parler un peu trop bien, un peu trop comme un livre, de ne pas<br/>avoir dans son langage le naturel qu’il y avait dans ses cravates<br/>lavallière toujours flottantes, dans son veston droit presque<br/>d’écolier. Elle s’étonnait aussi des tirades enflammées qu’il entamait<br/>souvent contre l’aristocratie, la vie mondaine, le snobisme,<br/>«certainement le péché auquel pense saint Paul quand il parle du péché<br/>pour lequel il n’y a pas de rémission</td>

<td>Ah! soupirait ma tante, je voudrais que ce soit déjà l’heure<br/>d’Eulalie. Il n’y a vraiment qu’elle qui pourra me dire cela.»<br/><br/><br/>Eulalie était une fille boiteuse, active et sourde qui s’était<br/>«retirée» après la mort de Mme  de la Bretonnerie où elle avait été en<br/>place depuis son enfance et qui avait pris à côté de l’église une<br/>chambre, d’où elle descendait tout le temps soit aux offices, soit, en<br/>dehors des offices, dire une petite prière ou donner un coup de main à<br/>Théodore; le reste du temps elle allait voir des personnes malades<br/>comme ma tante Léonie à qui elle racontait ce qui s’était passé à la<br/>messe ou aux vêpres. Elle ne dédaignait pas d’ajouter quelque casuel à<br/>la petite rente que lui servait la famille de ses anciens maîtres en<br/>allant de temps en temps visiter le linge du curé ou de quelque autre<br/>personnalité marquante du monde clérical de Combray. Elle portait<br/>au-dessus d’une mante de drap noir un petit béguin blanc, presque de<br/>religieuse, et une maladie de peau donnait à une partie de ses joues<br/>et à son nez recourbé, les tons rose vif de la balsamine. Ses visites<br/>étaient la grande distraction de ma tante Léonie qui ne recevait plus<br/>guère personne d’autre, en dehors de M. le Curé. Ma tante avait peu à<br/>peu évincé tous les autres visiteurs parce qu’ils avaient le tort à<br/>ses yeux de rentrer tous dans l’une ou l’autre des deux catégories de<br/>gens qu’elle détestait. Les uns, les pires et dont elle s’était<br/>débarrassée les premiers, étaient ceux qui lui conseillaient de ne pas<br/>«s’écouter» et professaient, fût-ce négativement et en ne la<br/>manifestant que par certains silences de désapprobation ou par<br/>certains sourires de doute, la doctrine subversive qu’une petite<br/>promenade au soleil et un bon bifteck saignant (quand elle gardait<br/>quatorze heures sur l’estomac deux méchantes gorgées d’eau de Vichy!)<br/>lui feraient plus de bien que son lit et ses médecines. L’autre<br/>catégorie se composait des personnes qui avaient l’air de croire<br/>qu’elle était plus gravement malade qu’elle ne pensait, était aussi<br/>gravement malade qu’elle le disait. Aussi, ceux qu’elle avait laissé<br/>monter après quelques hésitations et sur les officieuses instances de<br/>Françoise et qui, au cours de leur visite, avaient montré combien ils<br/>étaient indignes de la faveur qu’on leur faisait en risquant<br/>timidement un: «Ne croyez-vous pas que si vous vous secouiez un peu<br/>par un beau temps», ou qui, au contraire, quand elle leur avait dit:<br/>«Je suis bien bas, bien bas, c’est la fin, mes pauvres amis», lui<br/>avaient répondu: «Ah! quand on n’a pas la santé! Mais vous pouvez<br/>durer encore comme ça», ceux-là, les uns comme les autres, étaient<br/>sûrs de ne plus jamais être reçus. Et si Françoise s’amusait de l’air<br/>épouvanté de ma tante quand de son lit elle avait aperçu dans la rue<br/>du Saint-Esprit une de ces personnes qui avait l’air de venir chez<br/>elle ou quand elle avait entendu un coup de sonnette, elle riait<br/>encore bien plus, et comme d’un bon tour, des ruses toujours<br/>victorieuses de ma tante pour arriver à les faire congédier et de leur<br/>mine déconfite en s’en retournant sans l’avoir vue, et, au fond<br/>admirait sa maîtresse qu’elle jugeait supérieure à tous ces gens<br/>puisqu’elle ne voulait pas les recevoir. En somme, ma tante exigeait<br/>à la fois qu’on l’approuvât dans son régime, qu’on la plaignît pour<br/>ses souffrances et qu’on la rassurât sur son avenir.<br/><br/><br/>C’est à quoi Eulalie excellait. Ma tante pouvait lui dire vingt fois<br/>en une minute: «C’est la fin, ma pauvre Eulalie», vingt fois Eulalie<br/>répondait: «Connaissant votre maladie comme vous la connaissez, madame<br/>Octave, vous irez à cent ans, comme me disait hier encore Mme<br/>Sazerin.» (Une des plus fermes croyances d’Eulalie et que le nombre<br/>imposant des démentis apportés par l’expérience n’avait pas suffi à<br/>entamer, était que Mme  Sazerat s’appelait Mme  Sazerin.)<br/><br/></td>

<td>Mon oncle qui détestait prêter ses livres ne répondit rien et me<br/>conduisit jusqu’à l’antichambre. Éperdu d’amour pour la dame en rose,<br/>je couvris de baisers fous les joues pleines de tabac de mon vieil<br/>oncle, et tandis qu’avec assez d’embarras il me laissait entendre sans<br/>oser me le dire ouvertement qu’il aimerait autant que je ne parlasse<br/>pas de cette visite à mes parents, je lui disais, les larmes aux yeux,<br/>que le souvenir de sa bonté était en moi si fort que je trouverais<br/>bien un jour le moyen de lui témoigner ma reconnaissance. Il était si<br/>fort en effet que deux heures plus tard, après quelques phrases<br/>mystérieuses et qui ne me parurent pas donner à mes parents une idée<br/>assez nette de la nouvelle importance dont j’étais doué, je trouvai<br/>plus explicite de leur raconter dans les moindres détails la visite<br/>que je venais de faire. Je ne croyais pas ainsi causer d’ennuis à mon<br/>oncle. Comment l’aurais-je cru, puisque je ne le désirais pas. Et je<br/>ne pouvais supposer que mes parents trouveraient du mal dans une<br/>visite où je n’en trouvais pas.

Je<br/>résolus de m’abstenir de ce geste insuffisant et je détournai la tête.<br/>Mon oncle pensa que je suivais en cela les ordres de mes parents, il<br/>ne le leur pardonna pas, et il est mort bien des années après sans<br/>qu’aucun de nous l’ait jamais revu.<br/><br/><br/>Aussi je n’entrais plus dans le cabinet de repos maintenant fermé, de<br/>mon oncle</td>

<td>Après cette croyance centrale qui, pendant ma lecture, exécutait<br/>d’incessants mouvements du dedans au dehors, vers la découverte de la<br/>vérité, venaient les émotions que me donnait l’action à laquelle je<br/>prenais part, car ces après-midi-là étaient plus remplis d’événements<br/>dramatiques que ne l’est souvent toute une vie. C’était les événements<br/>qui survenaient dans le livre que je lisais; il est vrai que les<br/>personnages qu’ils affectaient n’étaient pas «Réels», comme disait<br/>Françoise. Mais tous les sentiments que nous font éprouver la joie ou<br/>l’infortune d’un personnage réel ne se produisent en nous que par<br/>l’intermédiaire d’une image de cette joie ou de cette infortune;<br/>l’ingéniosité du premier romancier consista à comprendre que dans<br/>l’appareil de nos émotions, l’image étant le seul élément essentiel,<br/>la simplification qui consisterait à supprimer purement et simplement<br/>les personnages réels serait un perfectionnement décisif. Un être<br/>réel, si profondément que nous sympathisions avec lui, pour une grande<br/>part est perçu par nos sens, c’est-à-dire nous reste opaque, offre un<br/>poids mort que notre sensibilité ne peut soulever. Qu’un malheur le<br/>frappe, ce n’est qu’en une petite partie de la notion totale que nous<br/>avons de lui, que nous pourrons en être émus; bien plus, ce n’est<br/>qu’en une partie de la notion totale qu’il a de soi qu’il pourra<br/>l’être lui-même. La trouvaille du romancier a été d’avoir l’idée de<br/>remplacer ces parties impénétrables à l’âme par une quantité égale de<br/>parties immatérielles, c’est-à-dire que notre âme peut s’assimiler.<br/>Qu’importe dès lors que les actions, les émotions de ces êtres d’un<br/>nouveau genre nous apparaissent comme vraies, puisque nous les avons<br/>faites nôtres, puisque c’est en nous qu’elles se produisent, qu’elles<br/>tiennent sous leur dépendance, tandis que nous tournons fiévreusement<br/>les pages du livre, la rapidité de notre respiration et l’intensité de<br/>notre regard. Et une fois que le romancier nous a mis dans cet état,<br/>où comme dans tous les états purement intérieurs, toute émotion est<br/>décuplée, où son livre va nous troubler à la façon d’un rêve mais d’un<br/>rêve plus clair que ceux que nous avons en dormant et dont le souvenir<br/>durera davantage, alors, voici qu’il déchaîne en nous pendant une<br/>heure tous les bonheurs et tous les malheurs possibles dont nous<br/>mettrions dans la vie des années à connaître quelques-uns, et dont les<br/>plus intenses ne nous seraient jamais révélés parce que la lenteur<br/>avec laquelle ils se produisent nous en ôte la perception; (ainsi<br/>notre cœur change, dans la vie, et c’est la pire douleur; mais nous ne<br/>la connaissons que dans la lecture, en imagination: dans la réalité il<br/>change, comme certains phénomènes de la nature se produisent, assez<br/>lentement pour que, si nous pouvons constater successivement chacun de<br/>ses états différents, en revanche la sensation même du changement nous<br/>soit épargnée).<br/><br/><br/>Déjà moins intérieur à mon corps que cette vie des personnages, venait<br/>ensuite, à demi projeté devant moi, le paysage où se déroulait<br/>l’action et qui exerçait sur ma pensée une bien plus grande influence<br/>que l’autre, que celui que j’avais sous les yeux quand je les levais<br/>du livre. C’est ainsi que pendant deux étés, dans la chaleur du jardin<br/>de Combray, j’ai eu, à cause du livre que je lisais alors, la<br/>nostalgie d’un pays montueux et fluviatile, où je verrais beaucoup de<br/>scieries et où, au fond de l’eau claire, des morceaux de bois<br/>pourrissaient sous des touffes de cresson: non loin montaient le long<br/>de murs bas, des grappes de fleurs violettes et rougeâtres. Et comme<br/>le rêve d’une femme qui m’aurait aimé était toujours présent à ma<br/>pensée, ces étés-là ce rêve fut imprégné de la fraîcheur des eaux<br/>courantes; et quelle que fût la femme que j’évoquais, des grappes de<br/>fleurs violettes et rougeâtres s’élevaient aussitôt de chaque côté<br/>d’elle comme des couleurs complémentaires.<br/><br/></td>

<td>Si mes parents m’avaient permis, quand je lisais un livre, d’aller<br/>visiter la région qu’il décrivait, j’aurais cru faire un pas<br/>inestimable dans la conquête de la vérité. Car si on a la sensation<br/>d’être toujours entouré de son âme, ce n’est pas comme d’une prison<br/>immobile: plutôt on est comme emporté avec elle dans un perpétuel élan<br/>pour la dépasser, pour atteindre à l’extérieur, avec une sorte de<br/>découragement, entendant toujours autour de soi cette sonorité<br/>identique qui n’est pas écho du dehors mais retentissement d’une<br/>vibration interne. On cherche à retrouver dans les choses, devenues<br/>par là précieuses, le reflet que notre âme a projeté sur elles; on est<br/>déçu en constatant qu’elles semblent dépourvues dans la nature, du<br/>charme qu’elles devaient, dans notre pensée, au voisinage de certaines<br/>idées; parfois on convertit toutes les forces de cette âme en<br/>habileté, en splendeur pour agir sur des êtres dont nous sentons bien<br/>qu’ils sont situés en dehors de nous et que nous ne les atteindrons<br/>jamais. Aussi, si j’imaginais toujours autour de la femme que<br/>j’aimais, les lieux que je désirais le plus alors, si j’eusse voulu<br/>que ce fût elle qui me les fît visiter, qui m’ouvrît l’accès d’un<br/>monde inconnu, ce n’était pas par le hasard d’une simple association<br/>de pensée; non, c’est que mes rêves de voyage et d’amour n’étaient que<br/>des moments—que je sépare artificiellement aujourd’hui comme si je<br/>pratiquais des sections à des hauteurs différentes d’un jet d’eau<br/>irisé et en apparence immobile—dans un même et infléchissable<br/>jaillissement de toutes les forces de ma vie.<br/><br/><br/>Enfin, en continuant à suivre du dedans au dehors les</td>

Bloch en effet ne fut pas réinvité à la<br/>maison. Il y avait d’abord été bien accueilli.

Oh! je me méfie.»<br/><br/><br/>Et il chantait:<br/><br/><br/>«Archers, faites bonne garde!<br/>Veillez sans trêve et sans bruit»;<br/><br/><br/>Et après nous avoir posé adroitement quelques questions plus précises,<br/>il s’écriait: «À la garde! À la garde!» ou, si c’était le patient<br/>lui-même déjà arrivé qu’il avait forcé à son insu, par un<br/>interrogatoire dissimulé, à confesser ses origines, alors pour nous<br/>montrer qu’il n’avait plus aucun doute, il se contentait de nous<br/>regarder en fredonnant imperceptiblement:<br/><br/><br/>«De ce timide Israëlite<br/>Quoi! vous guidez ici les pas!»<br/><br/><br/>ou:<br/><br/><br/>«Champs paternels, Hébron, douce vallée.»<br/><br/><br/>ou encore:<br/><br/><br/>«Oui, je suis de la race élue.»<br/><br/><br/>Ces petites manies de mon grand-père n’impliquaient aucun sentiment<br/>malveillant à l’endroit de mes camarades. Mais Bloch avait déplu à mes<br/>parents pour d’autres raisons. Il avait commencé par agacer mon père<br/>qui, le voyant mouillé, lui avait dit avec intérêt:<br/><br/><br/>—«Mais, monsieur Bloch, quel temps fait-il donc, est-ce qu’il a plu?<br/>Je n’y comprends rien, le baromètre était excellent.»<br/><br/><br/>Il n’en avait tiré que cette réponse:<br/><br/><br/>—«Monsieur, je ne puis absolument vous dire s’il a plu. Je vis si<br/>résolument en dehors des contingences physiques que mes sens ne<br/>prennent pas la peine de me les notifier.»<br/><br/><br/>—«Mais, mon pauvre fils, il est idiot ton ami, m’avait dit mon père<br/>quand Bloch fut parti. Comment! il ne peut même pas me dire le temps<br/>qu’il fait! Mais il n’y a rien de plus intéressant! C’est un imbécile.<br/><br/><br/>Puis Bloch avait déplu à ma grand’mère parce que, après le déjeuner<br/>comme elle disait qu’elle était un peu souffrante, il avait étouffé un<br/>sanglot et essuyé des larmes.<br/><br/><br/>—«Comment veux-tu que ça soit sincère, me dit-elle, puisqu’il ne me<br/>connaît pas; ou bien alors il est fou.»<br/><br/><br/>Et enfin il avait mécontenté tout le monde parce que, étant venu<br/>déjeuner une heure et demie en retard et couvert de boue, au lieu de<br/>s’excuser, il avait dit:<br/><br/><br/>—«Je ne me laisse jamais influencer par les perturbations de<br/>l’atmosphère ni par les divisions conventionnelles du temps. Je<br/>réhabiliterais volontiers l’usage de la pipe d’opium et du kriss<br/>malais, mais j’ignore celui de ces instruments infiniment plus<br/>pernicieux et d’ailleurs platement bourgeois, la montre et le<br/>parapluie.»<br/><br/><br/>Il serait malgré tout revenu à Combray. Il n’était pas pourtant l’ami<br/>que mes parents eussent souhaité pour moi; ils avaient fini par penser<br/>que les larmes que lui avait fait verser l’indisposition de ma<br/>grand’mère n’étaient pas feintes; mais ils savaient d’instinct ou par<br/>expérience que les élans de notre sensibilité ont peu d’empire sur la<br/>suite de nos actes et la conduite de notre vie, et que le respect des<br/>obligations morales, la fidélité aux amis, l’exécution d’une œuvre,<br/>l’observance d’un régime, ont un fondement plus sûr dans des habitudes<br/>aveugles que dans ces transports momentanés, ardents et stériles. Ils<br/>auraient préféré pour moi à Bloch des compagnons qui ne me donneraient<br/>pas plus qu’il n’est convenu d’accorder à ses amis, selon les règles<br/>de la morale bourgeoise; qui ne m’enverraient pas inopinément une<br/>corbeille de fruits parce qu’ils auraient ce jour-là pensé à moi avec<br/>tendresse, mais qui, n’étant pas capables de faire pencher en ma<br/>faveur la juste balance des devoirs et des exigences de l’amitié sur<br/>un simple mouvement de leur imagination et de leur sensibilité, ne la<br/>fausseraient pas davantage à mon préjudice. Nos torts même font<br/>difficilement départir de ce qu’elles nous doivent ces natures dont ma<br/>grand’tante était le modèle, elle qui brouillée depuis des années avec<br/>une nièce à qui elle ne parlait jamais, ne modifia pas pour cela le<br/>testament où elle lui laissait toute sa fortune, parce que c’était sa<br/>plus proche parente et que cela «se devait».</td>

Et sans doute lui-même devait<br/>sentir que là étaient ses plus grands charmes. Car dans les livres qui<br/>suivirent, s’il avait rencontré quelque grande vérité, ou le nom d’une<br/>célèbre cathédrale, il interrompait son récit et dans une invocation,<br/>une apostrophe, une longue prière, il donnait un libre cours à ces<br/>effluves qui dans ses premiers ouvrages restaient intérieurs à sa<br/>prose, décelés seulement alors par les ondulations de la surface, plus<br/>douces peut-être encore, plus harmonieuses quand elles étaient ainsi<br/>voilées et qu’on n’aurait pu indiquer d’une manière précise où<br/>naissait, où expirait leur murmure. Ces morceaux auxquels il se<br/>complaisait étaient nos morceaux préférés. Pour moi, je les savais par<br/>cœur. J’étais déçu quand il reprenait le fil de son récit. Chaque fois<br/>qu’il parlait de quelque chose dont la beauté m’était restée jusque-là<br/>cachée, des forêts de pins, de la grêle, de Notre-Dame de Paris,<br/>d’Athalie ou de Phèdre, il faisait dans une image exploser cette<br/>beauté jusqu’à moi. Aussi sentant combien il y avait de parties de<br/>l’univers que ma perception infirme ne distinguerait pas s’il ne les<br/>rapprochait de moi, j’aurais voulu posséder une opinion de lui, une<br/>métaphore de lui, sur toutes choses, surtout sur celles que j’aurais<br/>l’occasion de voir moi-même, et entre celles-là, particulièrement sur<br/>d’anciens monuments français et certains paysages maritimes, parce que<br/>l’insistance avec laquelle il les citait dans ses livres prouvait<br/>qu’il</td>

<td>He reached out towards Yaved, towards the ache, the suffering. As he came closer to it he felt a great strength flow into him from the west, as if Silence had taken him by the hand after all. Through that link he could send his own strength, the Mountain’s strength, to help. I didn’t tell him I wasn’t coming back, he thought, his last words in Hardic, his last grief, for he was in the bones of the mountain now. He knew the arteries of fire, and the beat of the great heart. He knew what to do. It was in no tongue of man that he said, “Be quiet, be easy. There now, there. Hold fast. So, there. We can be easy.”  And he was easy, he was still, he held fast, rock in rock and earth in earth in the fiery dark of the mountain.    It was their mage Ogion whom the people saw stand alone on the roof of the signal tower on the wharf, when the streets ran up and down in waves, the cobbles bursting out of them, and walls of clay brick puffed into dust, and the Armed Cliffs leaned together, groaning. It was Ogion they saw, his hands held out before him, straining, parting: and the cliffs parted with them, and stood straight, unmoved. The city shuddered and stood still. It was Ogion who stopped the earthquake. They saw it, they said it.  “My teacher was with me, and his teacher with him,” Ogion said when they praised him. “I could hold the Gate open because he held the Mountain still.” They praised his modesty and did not listen to him. Listening is a rare gift, and men will have their heroes.  </td>

Hanging there, waiting for my friend’s body, hoping for a miracle but knowing the sea rarely permits miracles, I examined the object in my hand. It was a name tag.  Euart.  He and Covill had used a rope to pull members of the 43rd Infantry to safety. The ship had listed so badly to port that it was impossible to cross the steep deck and reach the lifeboats. Without their heroic actions, many men would have gone down with the ship. Covill escaped, but Euart had gone back after something.  It would take me six months of research and phone calls, but I eventually located Warren Covill. He was old, but still alive. He remembered those days on the Coolidge like they were yesterday. He confirmed what I had already guessed. I know why Euart went back.  Army mess officer Captain Elwood Euart had kept a cat in his kitchen to keep the ship free of mice. A Siamese cat.</td>

His father had shouted that a student of Ard’s was no son of his, had nursed his rage, died unforgiving.  Dulse had seen young men weep for joy at the birth of a first son. He had seen poor men pay witches a year’s earnings for the promise of a healthy boy, and a rich man touch his gold-bedizened baby’s face and whisper, adoring, “My immortality!” He had seen men beat their sons, bully and humiliate them, spite and thwart them, hating the death they saw in them. He had seen the answering hatred in the sons’ eyes, the threat, the pitiless contempt. And seeing it, Dulse knew why he had never sought reconciliation with his father.  He had seen a father and son work together from daybreak to sundown, the old man guiding a blind ox, the middle-aged man driving the iron-bladed plough, never a word spoken.

According to him, he’d been outrunning a speeding ticket, his Camaro Z28 clocking over a hundred when an old woman had pulled out in front of him.

<td>There’s something out there,” he said. His face had that haunted look I had come to know. “A plane.”  I got to my feet and looked. The waves curled white and foamy, broke around the brown legs of the children, and scattered tiny bivalves on the beach. “I don’t see anything.”  He called over some of the children and tried to talk to them, but of course they didn’t speak English. Somehow he got through to them that he thought there was something on the ocean bottom, there just outside the breakers. They rolled their eyes. Of course there’s something out there, their expressions said. One of the older boys held out his arms and soared around the beach making airplane noises, his rags flapping in the breeze, while the other children laughed and jabbered in Malaysian. Edward bribed them to ferry us out beyond the surf in their outriggers—dangerous, as we didn’t have our dive gear with us. The children were careful with him, though. Besides, they lived their lives in those canoes, tooling about the islands the way an American child would ride around town on a bicycle. We stood more chance of being swallowed by a whale than one of the children tipping a canoe and letting Edward drown.  Not more than eight feet beneath the surface, we found the Kawanishi. The children had played in it all their lives.  As I said, I don’t know how he found them. He would laugh about it when I insisted there was something paranormal about the whole experience. He would point to the sonar and the depth finders and all the fancy equipment that the National Geographic Society had bought us. He would deny that there was anything strange going on.

At that time, age had only two demographic categories: Youth, someone such as myself, an aspiring magician with all the time needed to learn the conjuring arts. And lack-of-youth, which meant irrelevant and musty and unintelligible.  Klingman was, I would now guess, no more than fifty years old. His skin, however, was already giving in to the cruelties of gravity if not sunlight (he was not an outdoorsman and, today, I might speculate that he was anemic). He was short and round, a pear-shaped lump of dough. He had bushy gray eyebrows, purple caverns below the eyes. There was a long-faded scar on the bottom of his chin. Sea-green eyes and a badly cut monk’s crown of hair. There were liver spots speckling his dome. He needed a shave and a conscientious barber would have trimmed the nose hair without waiting to be asked. He wore wire-rimmed glasses of the old variety, round lenses with either a rust-colored or industrial silver frame.  </td>

<td>In my youth, there was a time when I was obsessed with playing cards. At the de Sale School I was, by far, the best card player. This is no great boast, however. I came of age too late, at a time when boys had, by and large, abandoned the love of a long card game. The art of the deal and the play and the bluff was no longer inculcated in the young. After the first few times I cleaned out the rare poker enthusiasts on campus, no one wanted to go to the green felt with me. I was left to a dozen variations of solitaire and, more importantly, manipulation.  I believe at some point I have written of my boyhood enthrallment with sleight-of-hand magic. My interest began with a young fan’s appreciation for the Masters—Arthur Lloyd, Herbert Brooks, the great Archie Tear. In due course I began to emulate my idols and found that I had a). the long, tapered fingers that are made for such a skill and b). the infinite patience and the love of repetition and the satisfaction of my own company that allows for the kind of endless practice that the skill requires in order to be elevated into art. I trained compulsively, to the detriment of my studies and my friendships, but before long I could handle a Greek Shuffle or a Mongolian Crimp with the nonchalance of a professional. I could palm and riffle, spring and jog in my sleep. I had two Svengali decks, one of which had been made in London by Elmsley himself (or so the salesman told me). I amazed my dormitory mates with a slew of vintage tricks, all of which were new to these rubes. They sat in the hallway late into the night, sipping their tonics and trying not to blink, their backs rigid against the ancient horsehair plaster as I led them like lemmings through the O’Henry and the Gemini, through Liar Liar and the King’s Robbery.</td>

I remember when he spotted that B-17 lying off Rabaul. We hadn’t even been looking for anything that day, but the depth finder had been running, plotting a rough outline of the sea floor in blocky LCD pixels. Without a word, Edward had slowed the engine and brought the boat around. He pointed at what, to me, appeared to be nothing more than another stretch of coral reef.  “That’s an airplane,” he said. “A big airplane.”  “I think you’re full of shit.”  “A hundred dollars says I’m right.”  So we dove, and we found the B-17 embedded in the reef 150 feet beneath the surface. The photos I took made the cover of Newsweek. The B-17 had gone down in 1943, caught in severe weather after skip-bombing</td>

<td>Edward sipped his rum and tried to look comfortable, but I knew him too well. He fidgeted with the wheel brakes on his chair and made a great show of adjusting his bicycle gloves. Public places make him nervous, especially places like this remote bar which had never heard of accommodations for the handicapped. It had been a struggle just to get the wheelchair maneuvered through all the tables and, once there, our table was too low, meaning that Edward’s chair had to sit out in the aisle, a good arm’s length and a stretch from his drink. He’d told me before that it seemed everyone stared at him in places like this. That he could feel a million eyes on him, wondering how he’d ended up in the chair, wondering just how wasted were the remnants of his legs, hidden beneath the tweed throw. Edward was most comfortable in the sea, where the Farallon DPV gave him greater range and speed than any diver I knew. Even before he’d been able to afford the Diver Propulsion Vehicle, though, his powerful arms had made him an accomplished diver. Here . . . in the resort’s surfside bar... he was truly a fish out of water.  “You want to go on up to your</td>

<td>condition as strongly as I could in my few letters home, my mother likewise refused to hear. Schooling was the hallmark of a gentleman, and schooling I must have, though it cost me my soul.  It is from those hellish days, I think, that my whole hatred of boys stems. For though I was fallen among that company of the bestial and cruel, there were those I hated more: the careless golden souls who walked through chamber and hall as if untouched by their surroundings. Prefects and tutors vied for their regard, and cruelties and punishments alike fell lightly upon their oblivious shoulders. Their futures were assured—futures of rank and privilege among men of learning and dignity. In light of such future satisfaction, the present was a dim and trivial shadow.  </td>

<td>I clasped the pen between my fingers and dipped it into the captain’s silver inkwell. I wrote my first name—James—in bold flowing letters, but then I hesitated. Not for weakness’ sake, but for a notion that had come into my head. This was my birth into a new life, and I vowed that in it I would be the foolish and villainous Cruikshank no loner. Among this gallant company I would take a new name.  Something stronger.  Something sharper.  And so I signed. “James Hook” in a bold sweeping style, and sealed my destiny among the Midnight Folk.

<td>Quand je dis qu’en dehors d’événements très rares, comme cet<br/>accouchement, le traintrain de ma tante ne subissait jamais aucune<br/>variation, je ne parle pas de celles qui, se répétant toujours<br/>identiques à des intervalles réguliers, n’introduisaient au sein de<br/>l’uniformité qu’une sorte d’uniformité secondaire. C’est ainsi que<br/>tous les samedis, comme Françoise allait dans l’après-midi au marché<br/>de Roussainville-le-Pin, le déjeuner était, pour tout le monde, une<br/>heure plus tôt. Et ma tante avait si bien pris l’habitude de cette<br/>dérogation hebdomadaire à ses habitudes, qu’elle tenait à cette<br/>habitude-là autant qu’aux autres. Elle y était si bien «routinée»,<br/>comme disait Françoise, que s’il lui avait fallu un samedi, attendre<br/>pour déjeuner l’heure habituelle, cela l’eût autant «dérangée» que si<br/>elle avait dû, un autre jour, avancer son déjeuner à l’heure du<br/>samedi. Cette avance du déjeuner donnait d’ailleurs au samedi, pour<br/>nous tous, une figure particulière, indulgente, et assez sympathique.<br/>Au moment où d’habitude on a encore une heure à vivre avant la détente<br/>du repas, on savait que, dans quelques secondes, on allait voir<br/>arriver des endives précoces, une omelette de faveur, un bifteck<br/>immérité. Le retour de ce samedi asymétrique était un de ces petits<br/>événements intérieurs, locaux, presque civiques qui, dans les vies<br/>tranquilles et les sociétés fermées, créent une sorte de lien national<br/>et deviennent le thème favori des conversations, des plaisanteries,<br/>des récits exagérés à plaisir: il eût été le noyau tout prêt pour un<br/>cycle légendaire si l’un de nous avait eu la tête épique. Dès le<br/>matin, avant d’être habillés, sans raison, pour le plaisir d’éprouver<br/>la force de la solidarité, on se disait les uns aux autres avec bonne<br/>humeur, avec cordialité, avec patriotisme: «Il n’y a pas de temps à<br/>perdre, n’oublions pas que c’est samedi!» cependant que ma tante,<br/>conférant avec Françoise et songeant que la journée serait plus longue<br/>que d’habitude, disait: «Si vous leur faisiez un beau morceau de veau,<br/>comme c’est samedi.» Si à dix heures et demie un distrait tirait sa<br/>montre en disant: «Allons, encore une heure et demie avant le<br/>déjeuner», chacun était enchanté d’avoir à lui dire: «Mais voyons, à<br/>quoi pensez-vous, vous oubliez que c’est samedi!»; on en riait encore<br/>un quart d’heure après et on se promettait de monter raconter cet<br/>oubli à ma tante pour l’amuser.

<td>après la mort de sa<br/>femme et un héritage qu’il avait fait, il s’était retiré auprès de<br/>Combray, on le recevait souvent à la maison. Mais d’une pudibonderie<br/>excessive, il cessa de venir pour ne pas rencontrer Swann qui avait<br/>fait ce qu’il appelait «un mariage déplacé, dans le goût du jour». Ma<br/>mère, ayant appris qu’il composait, lui avait dit par amabilité que,<br/>quand elle irait le voir, il faudrait qu’il lui fît entendre quelque<br/>chose de lui. M. Vinteuil en aurait eu beaucoup de joie, mais il<br/>poussait la politesse et la bonté jusqu’à de tels scrupules que, se<br/>mettant toujours à la place des autres, il craignait de les ennuyer et<br/>de leur paraître égoïste s’il suivait ou seulement laissait deviner<br/>son désir. Le jour où mes parents étaient allés chez lui en visite, je<br/>les avais accompagnés, mais ils m’avaient permis de rester dehors et,<br/>comme la maison de M. Vinteuil, Montjouvain, était en contre-bas d’un<br/>monticule buissonneux, où je m’étais caché, je m’étais trouvé de<br/>plain-pied avec le salon du second étage, à cinquante centimètres de<br/>la fenêtre. Quand on était venu lui annoncer mes parents, j’avais vu<br/>M. Vinteuil se hâter de mettre en évidence sur le piano un morceau de<br/>musique. Mais une fois mes parents entrés, il l’avait retiré et mis<br/>dans un coin. Sans doute avait-il craint de leur laisser supposer<br/>qu’il n’était heureux de les voir que pour leur jouer de ses<br/>compositions. Et chaque fois que ma mère était revenue à la charge au<br/>cours de la visite, il avait répété plusieurs fois «Mais je ne sais<br/>qui a mis cela sur le piano, ce n’est pas sa place», et avait détourné<br/>la conversation sur d’autres sujets, justement parce que ceux-là<br/>l’intéressaient moins. Sa seule passion était pour sa fille et<br/>celle-ci qui avait l’air d’un garçon paraissait si robuste qu’on ne<br/>pouvait s’empêcher de sourire en voyant les précautions que son père<br/>prenait pour elle, ayant toujours des châles supplémentaires à lui<br/>jeter sur les épaules. Ma grand’mère faisait remarquer quelle<br/>expression douce délicate, presque timide passait souvent dans les<br/>regards de cette enfant si rude, dont le visage était semé de taches<br/>de son. Quand elle venait de prononcer une parole elle l’entendait<br/>avec l’esprit de ceux à qui elle l’avait dite, s’alarmait des<br/>malentendus possibles et on voyait s’éclairer, se découper comme par<br/>transparence, sous la figure hommasse du «bon diable», les traits plus<br/>fins d’une jeune fille éplorée.</td>

<td>Mais le jour où, pendant que mon père consultait le conseil de famille<br/>sur la rencontre de Legrandin, je descendis à la cuisine, était un de<br/>ceux où la Charité de Giotto, très malade de son accouchement récent,<br/>ne pouvait se lever; Françoise, n’étant plus aidée, était en retard.<br/>Quand je fus en bas, elle était en train, dans l’arrière-cuisine qui<br/>donnait sur la basse-cour, de tuer un poulet qui, par sa résistance<br/>désespérée et bien naturelle, mais accompagnée par Françoise hors<br/>d’elle, tandis qu’elle cherchait à lui fendre le cou sous l’oreille,<br/>des cris de «sale bête! sale bête!», mettait la sainte douceur et<br/>l’onction de notre servante un peu moins en lumière qu’il n’eût fait,<br/>au dîner du lendemain, par sa peau brodée d’or comme une chasuble et<br/>son jus précieux égoutté d’un ciboire. Quand il fut mort, Françoise<br/>recueillit le sang qui coulait sans noyer sa rancune, eut encore un<br/>sursaut de colère, et regardant le cadavre de son ennemi, dit une<br/>dernière fois: «Sale bête!» Je remontai tout tremblant; j’aurais voulu<br/>qu’on mît Françoise tout de suite à la porte. Mais qui m’eût fait des<br/>boules aussi chaudes, du café aussi parfumé, et même... ces<br/>poulets?... Et en réalité, ce lâche calcul, tout le monde avait eu à<br/>le faire comme moi. Car ma tante Léonie savait,—ce que j’ignorais<br/>encore,—que Françoise qui, pour sa fille, pour ses neveux, aurait<br/>donné sa vie sans une plainte, était pour d’autres êtres d’une dureté<br/>singulière. Malgré cela ma tante l’avait gardée, car si elle<br/>connaissait sa cruauté, elle appréciait son service. Je m’aperçus peu<br/>à peu que la douceur, la componction, les vertus de Françoise<br/>cachaient des tragédies d’arrière-cuisine, comme l’histoire découvre<br/>que les règnes des Rois et des Reines, qui sont représentés les mains<br/>jointes dans les vitraux des églises, furent marqués d’incidents<br/>sanglants. Je me rendis compte que, en dehors de ceux de sa parenté,<br/>les humains excitaient d’autant plus sa pitié par leurs malheurs,<br/>qu’ils vivaient plus éloignés d’elle. Les torrents de larmes qu’elle<br/>versait en lisant le journal sur les infortunes des inconnus se<br/>tarissaient vite si elle pouvait se représenter la personne qui en<br/>était l’objet d’une façon un peu précise. Une de ces nuits qui<br/>suivirent l’accouchement de la fille de cuisine, celle-ci fut prise<br/>d’atroces coliques; maman l’entendit se plaindre, se leva et réveilla<br/>Françoise qui, insensible, déclara que tous ces cris étaient une<br/>comédie, qu’elle voulait «faire la maîtresse». Le médecin, qui<br/>craignait ces crises, avait mis un signet, dans un livre de médecine<br/>que nous avions, à la page où elles sont décrites et où il nous avait<br/>dit de nous reporter pour trouver l’indication des premiers soins à<br/>donner. Ma mère envoya Françoise chercher le livre en lui recommandant<br/>de ne pas laisser tomber le signet. Au bout d’une heure, Françoise<br/>n’était pas revenue; ma mère indignée crut qu’elle s’était recouchée<br/>et me dit d’aller voir moi-même dans la bibliothèque. J’y trouvai<br/>Françoise qui, ayant voulu regarder ce que le signet marquait, lisait<br/>la description clinique de la crise et poussait des sanglots<br/>maintenant qu’il s’agissait d’une malade-type qu’elle ne connaissait<br/>pas. A chaque symptôme douloureux mentionné par l’auteur du traité,<br/>elle s’écriait: «Hé là! Sainte Vierge, est-il possible que le bon Dieu<br/>veuille faire souffrir ainsi une malheureuse créature humaine? Hé! la<br/>pauvre!»<br/><br/><br/>Mais dès que je l’eus appelée et qu’elle fut revenue près du lit de la<br/>Charité de Giotto, ses larmes cessèrent aussitôt de couler; elle ne<br/>put reconnaître ni cette agréable sensation de pitié et<br/>d’attendrissement qu’elle connaissait bien et que la lecture des<br/>journaux lui avait souvent donnée, ni aucun plaisir de même famille,<br/>dans l’ennui et dans l’irritation de s’être levée au milieu de la nuit<br/>pour la fille de cuisine; et à la vue des mêmes souffrances dont la<br/>description l’avait fait pleurer, elle n’eut plus que des<br/>ronchonnements de mauvaise humeur, même d’affreux sarcasmes, disant,<br/>quand elle crut que nous étions partis et ne pouvions plus l’entendre:<br/>«Elle n’avait qu’à ne pas faire ce qu’il faut pour ça! ça lui a fait<br/>plaisir! qu’elle ne fasse pas de manières maintenant. Faut-il tout de<br/>même qu’un garçon ait été abandonné du bon Dieu pour aller avec ça.<br/>Ah! c’est bien comme on disait dans le patois de ma pauvre mère:<br/><br/><br/>«Qui du cul d’un chien s’amourose<br/><br/><br/>«Il lui paraît une rose.»<br/><br/><br/>Si, quand son petit-fils était un peu enrhumé du cerveau, elle partait<br/>la nuit, même malade, au lieu de se coucher, pour voir s’il n’avait<br/>besoin de rien, faisant quatre lieues à pied avant le jour afin d’être<br/>rentrée pour son travail, en revanche ce même amour des siens et son<br/>désir d’assurer la grandeur future de sa maison se traduisait dans sa<br/>politique à l’égard des autres domestiques par une maxime constante<br/>qui fut de n’en jamais laisser un seul s’implanter chez ma tante,<br/>qu’elle mettait d’ailleurs une sorte d’orgueil à ne laisser approcher<br/>par personne, préférant, quand elle-même était malade, se relever pour<br/>lui donner son eau de Vichy plutôt que de permettre l’accès de la<br/>chambre de sa maîtresse à la fille de cuisine. Et comme cet<br/>hyménoptère observé par Fabre, la guêpe fouisseuse, qui pour que ses<br/>petits après sa mort aient de la viande fraîche à manger, appelle<br/>l’anatomie au secours de sa cruauté et, ayant capturé des charançons<br/>et des araignées, leur perce avec un savoir et une adresse merveilleux<br/>le centre nerveux d’où dépend le mouvement des pattes, mais non les<br/>autres fonctions de la vie, de façon que l’insecte paralysé près<br/>duquel elle dépose ses œufs, fournisse aux larves, quand elles<br/>écloront un gibier docile, inoffensif, incapable de fuite ou de<br/>résistance, mais nullement faisandé, Françoise trouvait pour servir sa<br/>volonté permanente de rendre la maison intenable à tout domestique,<br/>des ruses si savantes et si impitoyables que, bien des années plus<br/>tard, nous apprîmes que si cet été-là nous avions mangé presque tous<br/>les jours des asperges, c’était parce que leur odeur donnait à la<br/>pauvre fille de cuisine chargée de les éplucher des crises d’asthme<br/>d’une telle violence qu’elle fut obligée de finir par s’en aller.</td>

Cette dame le pria de dire quelque chose à son cocher,<br/>et tandis qu’il allait jusqu’à la voiture, l’empreinte de joie timide<br/>et dévouée que la présentation avait marquée sur son visage y<br/>persistait encore. Ravi dans une sorte de rêve, il souriait, puis il<br/>revint vers la dame en se hâtant et, comme il marchait plus vite qu’il<br/>n’en avait l’habitude, ses deux épaules oscillaient de droite et de<br/>gauche ridiculement, et il avait l’air tant il s’y abandonnait<br/>entièrement en n’ayant plus souci du reste, d’être le jouet inerte et<br/>mécanique du bonheur</td>

Or elle aimait beaucoup autrefois cette propriété, et<br/>d’ailleurs les visites de Swann avaient été les dernières qu’elle<br/>avait reçues, alors qu’elle fermait déjà sa porte à tout le monde. Et<br/>de même que quand il venait maintenant prendre de ses nouvelles (elle<br/>était la seule personne de chez nous qu’il demandât encore à voir),<br/>elle lui faisait répondre qu’elle était fatiguée, mais qu’elle le<br/>laisserait entrer la prochaine fois, de même elle dit ce soir-là:<br/>«Oui, un jour qu’il fera beau, j’irai en voiture jusqu’à la porte du<br/>parc.» C’est sincèrement qu’elle le disait. Elle eût aimé revoir Swann<br/>et Tansonville; mais le désir qu’elle en avait suffisait à ce qui lui<br/>restait de forces; sa réalisation les eût excédées. Quelquefois le<br/>beau temps lui rendait un peu de vigueur, elle se levait, s’habillait;<br/>la fatigue commençait avant qu’elle fût passée dans l’autre chambre et<br/>elle réclamait son lit. Ce qui avait commencé pour elle—plus tôt<br/>seulement que cela n’arrive d’habitude,—c’est ce grand renoncement de<br/>la vieillesse qui se prépare à la mort, s’enveloppe dans sa<br/>chrysalide, et qu’on peut observer, à la fin des vies qui se<br/>prolongent tard, même entre les anciens amants qui se sont le plus<br/>aimés, entre les amis unis par les liens les plus spirituels et qui à<br/>partir d’une certaine année cessent de faire le voyage ou la sortie<br/>nécessaire pour se voir, cessent de s’écrire et savent qu’ils ne<br/>communiqueront plus en ce monde. Ma tante devait parfaitement savoir<br/>qu’elle ne reverrait pas Swann, qu’elle ne quitterait plus jamais la<br/>maison, mais cette réclusion définitive devait lui être rendue assez<br/>aisée pour la raison même qui selon nous aurait dû la lui rendre plus<br/>douloureuse: c’est que cette réclusion lui était imposée par la<br/>diminution qu’elle pouvait constater chaque jour dans ses forces, et<br/>qui, en faisant de chaque action, de chaque mouvement, une fatigue,<br/>sinon une souffrance, donnait pour elle à l’inaction, à l’isolement,<br/>au silence, la douceur réparatrice et bénie du repos.<br/><br/></td>

Ce nom, devenu pour moi presque mythologique, de Swann, quand<br/>je causais avec mes parents, je languissais du besoin de le leur<br/>entendre dire, je n’osais pas le prononcer moi-même, mais je les<br/>entraînais sur des sujets qui avoisinaient Gilberte et sa famille, qui<br/>la concernaient, où je ne me sentais pas exilé trop loin d’elle; et je<br/>contraignais tout d’un coup mon père, en feignant de croire par<br/>exemple que la charge de mon grand-père avait été déjà avant lui dans<br/>notre famille, ou que la haie d’épines roses que voulait voir ma tante<br/>Léonie se trouvait en terrain communal, à rectifier mon assertion, à<br/>me dire, comme malgré moi, comme de lui-même: «Mais non, cette<br/>charge-là était au père de Swann, cette haie fait partie du parc de<br/>Swann.» Alors j’étais obligé de reprendre ma respiration, tant, en se<br/>posant sur la place où il était toujours écrit en moi, pesait à<br/>m’étouffer ce nom qui, au moment où je l’entendais, me paraissait plus<br/>plein que tout autre, parce qu’il était lourd de toutes les fois où,<br/>d’avance, je l’avais mentalement proféré. Il me causait un plaisir que<br/>j’étais confus d’avoir osé réclamer à mes parents</td>

<td>Cette année-là, quand, un peu plus tôt que d’habitude, mes parents<br/>eurent fixé le jour de rentrer à Paris, le matin du départ, comme on<br/>m’avait fait friser pour être photographié, coiffer avec précaution un<br/>chapeau que je n’avais encore jamais mis et revêtir une douillette de<br/>velours, après m’avoir cherché partout, ma mère me trouva en larmes<br/>dans le petit raidillon, contigu à Tansonville, en train de dire adieu<br/>aux aubépines, entourant de mes bras les branches piquantes, et, comme<br/>une princesse de tragédie à qui pèseraient ces vains ornements, ingrat<br/>envers l’importune main qui en formant tous ces nœuds avait pris soin<br/>sur mon front d’assembler mes cheveux, foulant aux pieds mes<br/>papillotes arrachées et mon chapeau neuf. Ma mère ne fut pas touchée<br/>par mes larmes, mais elle ne put retenir un cri à la vue de la coiffe<br/>défoncée et de la douillette perdue. Je ne l’entendis pas: «O mes<br/>pauvres petites aubépines, disais-je en pleurant, ce n’est pas vous<br/>qui voudriez me faire du chagrin, me forcer à partir. Vous, vous ne<br/>m’avez jamais fait de peine! Aussi je vous aimerai toujours.» Et,<br/>essuyant mes larmes, je leur promettais, quand je serais grand, de ne<br/>pas imiter la vie insensée des autres hommes et, même à Paris, les<br/>jours de printemps, au lieu d’aller faire des visites et écouter des<br/>niaiseries, de partir dans la campagne voir les premières aubépines</td>

<td>comme deux épis.<br/><br/><br/>A intervalles symétriques, au milieu de l’inimitable ornementation de<br/>leurs feuilles qu’on ne peut confondre avec la feuille d’aucun autre<br/>arbre fruitier, les pommiers ouvraient leurs larges pétales de satin<br/>blanc ou suspendaient les timides bouquets de leurs rougissants<br/>boutons. C’est du côté de Méséglise que j’ai remarqué pour la première<br/>fois l’ombre ronde que les pommiers font sur la terre ensoleillée, et<br/>aussi ces soies d’or impalpable que le couchant tisse obliquement sous<br/>les feuilles, et que je voyais mon père interrompre de sa canne sans<br/>les faire jamais dévier.<br/><br/><br/>Parfois dans le ciel de l’après-midi passait la lune blanche comme une<br/>nuée, furtive, sans éclat, comme une actrice dont ce n’est pas l’heure<br/>de jouer et qui, de la salle, en toilette de ville, regarde un moment<br/>ses camarades, s’effaçant, ne voulant pas qu’on fasse attention à<br/>elle. J’aimais à retrouver son image dans des tableaux et dans des<br/>livres, mais ces œuvres d’art étaient bien différentes—du moins<br/>pendant les premières années, avant que Bloch eût accoutumé mes yeux<br/>et ma pensée à des harmonies plus subtiles—de celles où la lune me<br/>paraîtrait belle aujourd’hui et où je ne l’eusse pas reconnue alors.<br/>C’était, par exemple, quelque roman de Saintine, un paysage de Gleyre<br/>où elle découpe nettement sur le ciel une faucille d’argent, de ces<br/>œuvres naïvement incomplètes comme étaient mes propres impressions et<br/>que les sœurs de ma grand’mère s’indignaient de me voir aimer. Elles<br/>pensaient qu’on doit mettre devant les enfants, et qu’ils font preuve<br/>de goût en aimant d’abord, les œuvres que, parvenu à la maturité, on<br/>admire définitivement.

<td>C’est du côté de Méséglise, à Montjouvain, maison située au bord d’une<br/>grande mare et adossée à un talus buissonneux que demeurait M.<br/>Vinteuil. Aussi croisait-on souvent sur la route sa fille, conduisant<br/>un buggy à toute allure. A partir d’une certaine année on ne la<br/>rencontra plus seule, mais avec une amie plus âgée, qui avait mauvaise<br/>réputation dans le pays et qui un jour s’installa définitivement à<br/>Montjouvain. On disait: «Faut-il que ce pauvre M. Vinteuil soit<br/>aveuglé par la tendresse pour ne pas s’apercevoir de ce qu’on raconte,<br/>et permettre à sa fille, lui qui se scandalise d’une parole déplacée,<br/>de faire vivre sous son toit une femme pareille. Il dit que c’est une<br/>femme supérieure, un grand cœur et qu’elle aurait eu des dispositions<br/>extraordinaires pour la musique si elle les avait cultivées. Il peut<br/>être sûr que ce n’est pas de musique qu’elle s’occupe avec sa fille.»<br/>M. Vinteuil le disait; et il est en effet remarquable combien une<br/>personne excite toujours d’admiration pour ses qualités morales chez<br/>les parents de toute autre personne avec qui elle a des relations<br/>charnelles. L’amour physique, si injustement décrié, force tellement<br/>tout être à manifester jusqu’aux moindres parcelles qu’il possède de<br/>bonté, d’abandon de soi, qu’elles resplendissent jusqu’aux yeux de<br/>l’entourage immédiat. Le docteur Percepied à qui sa grosse voix et ses<br/>gros sourcils permettaient de tenir tant qu’il voulait le rôle de<br/>perfide dont il n’avait pas le physique, sans compromettre en rien sa<br/>réputation inébranlable et imméritée de bourru bienfaisant, savait<br/>faire rire aux larmes le curé et tout le monde en disant d’un ton<br/>rude: «Hé bien! il paraît qu’elle fait de la musique avec son amie,<br/>Mlle  Vinteuil. Ça a l’air de vous étonner. Moi je sais pas. C’est le<br/>père Vinteuil qui m’a encore dit ça hier. Après tout, elle a bien le<br/>droit d’aimer la musique, c’te fille. Moi je ne suis pas pour<br/>contrarier les vocations artistiques des enfants. Vinteuil non plus à<br/>ce qu’il paraît. Et puis lui aussi il fait de la musique avec l’amie<br/>de sa fille. Ah! sapristi on en fait une musique dans c’te boîte-là.<br/>Mais qu’est-ce que vous avez à rire; mais ils font trop de musique ces<br/>gens. L’autre jour j’ai rencontré le père Vinteuil près du cimetière.<br/>Il ne tenait pas sur ses jambes.»<br/><br/><br/>Pour ceux qui comme nous virent à cette époque M. Vinteuil éviter les<br/>personnes qu’il connaissait, se détourner quand il les apercevait,<br/>vieillir en quelques mois, s’absorber dans son chagrin, devenir<br/>incapable de tout effort qui n’avait pas directement le bonheur de sa<br/>fille pour but, passer des journées entières devant la tombe de sa<br/>femme,—il eût été difficile de ne pas comprendre qu’il était en train<br/>de mourir de chagrin, et de supposer qu’il ne se rendait pas compte<br/>des propos qui couraient. Il les connaissait, peut-être même y<br/>ajoutait-il foi. Il n’est peut-être pas une personne, si grande que<br/>soit sa vertu, que la complexité des circonstances ne puisse amener à<br/>vivre un jour dans la familiarité du vice qu’elle condamne le plus<br/>formellement,—sans qu’elle le reconnaisse d’ailleurs tout à fait sous<br/>le déguisement de faits particuliers qu’il revêt pour entrer en<br/>contact avec elle et la faire souffrir: paroles bizarres, attitude<br/>inexplicable, un certain soir, de tel être qu’elle a par ailleurs tant<br/>de raisons pour aimer. Mais pour un homme comme M. Vinteuil il devait<br/>entrer bien plus de souffrance que pour un autre dans la résignation à<br/>une de ces situations qu’on croit à tort être l’apanage exclusif du<br/>monde de la bohème: elles se produisent chaque fois qu’a besoin de se<br/>réserver la place et la sécurité qui lui sont nécessaires, un vice que<br/>la nature elle-même fait épanouir chez un enfant, parfois rien qu’en<br/>mêlant les vertus de son père et de sa mère, comme la couleur de ses<br/>yeux. Mais de ce que M. Vinteuil connaissait peut-être la conduite de<br/>sa fille, il ne s’ensuit pas que son culte pour elle en eût été<br/>diminué. Les faits ne pénètrent pas dans le monde où vivent nos<br/>croyances, ils n’ont pas fait naître celles-ci, ils ne les détruisent<br/>pas; ils peuvent leur infliger les plus constants démentis sans les<br/>affaiblir, et une avalanche de malheurs ou de maladies se succédant<br/>sans interruption dans une famille, ne la fera pas douter de la bonté<br/>de son Dieu ou du talent de son médecin. </td>

You’ve never looked on the face of a god before.<br/><br/>  The entry obediently enlarges, swims into focus, and you are rather disappointed. The man before you looks so ordinary, so generic, that he might pass for a member of nearly any ethnic group in any country in the world. Well, perhaps he’d be most successful in the Mediterranean area; but you have an uneasy feeling that if he wore lederhosen or a silk kimono, or got a really deep tan, he’d still mingle unnoticed anywhere. He has bright, friendly little black eyes. He has a neat little black beard and moustache, like a cartoon devil.<br/><br/>  The text beside his image tells you his designation is JOSEPH, that he is a Facilitator Grade One, that his acquisition date was 18,145 B.C.E., (Gregorian) 25 November, at Irun del Mar, Basque Republic. If you can believe what you’re reading, this man sprayed fixative on cave paintings, hid treasure in pyramids as they were being built, wore a toga, marched with legionaries, preached sermons most piously. And worked in the New World too; here’s a mention of the trickster Coyote. And here’s a long, long list of work in the entertainment industry.<br/><br/>  The text states further that he was processed at Eurobase One, that his ethics programming is flexible, and that he has a disinformation capacity of ninety-eight percent, but you don’t really absorb this last bit because your mind is still grappling with the implications of his career. Wouldn’t it mean that this man is over twenty thousand years old?<br/><br/>  Well? You were told Dr. Zeus Incorporated could create immortals, weren’t you?</td>

I never let her read anything I wrote, although she loved science fiction.<br/><br/>  Then she was, abruptly, diagnosed with something awful and lasted only a month.

And the train was pulling out of the station so Just, and I was standing there like an idiot on the platform, with almost no time to say I was sorry. But, pacing by her bed 1 explained the whole Company idea, and made up a short story to illustrate the way it worked, about Mendoza and Joseph trying to steal a rare plant.

<td>In the end, Budu was the one who made the speech, rounding up what was left of the two tribes and penning them together to listen to him.<br/><br/>  It wasn’t a long speech, no flowers of rhetoric such as Sarpa might have come up with. Budu just laid it out for them, simple and straight. From now on, they were all to live together in peace. They would intermarry and have children. There would be no more cannibalism. There would be no more fighting. The penalty for disobedience would be death.<br/><br/>  Then Budu told them that we were going, and they were to bury what we’d left them of their dead. He warned them, though, that we were only going up the mountain, above the tree line into the mist, and we’d be watching them always from the high places.<br/><br/>  And we did. We were up here thirty years. It turned out to be a good thing for us, too, because while we were overseeing the integration of the two tribes, Budu worked out a proposal for our masters. I told you he’d studied their future history. He knew what kind of an opening they needed, and he gave them one. He pointed out the nearly universal existence of places we could fit in the mortals’ mythology. Not just of your village, mortal; every village there is, anywhere.<br/><br/>  Legends of gods, or giants or trolls or demons, who live up somewhere high and bring judgment on mankind. Sometimes terrible, sometimes benign, but not to be screwed with, ever! Sometimes they’re supposed to live on one specific mountain, like this one; sometimes the story gets garbled and they’re thought to live in the clouds, or the sky. Someplace up. Hell, there’s even a story about a big man with a beard who lives at the North Pole, who rewards and punishes children. I think he’s called Satan… or was it Nobodaddy? It doesn’t matter.<br/><br/>  Anyway, Budu showed our masters that his proposal fit right in with recorded history, was in fact vital to the development of mortal religion. And, while I understand they don’t approve of religion much up there in the future, they do like to be absolutely sure that history rolls along smoothly. Messing with causality scares them.<br/><br/>  What was his proposal, mortal? Come on, can’t you think? What if I give you three guesses? No?<br/><br/>  </td>

I like things with ships on them. But I wanted to see how you were so I came in here. How are you doing?<br/><br/>  You were sad when I saw you before. Are you happier now?”<br/><br/>  Will opened his mouth to sing the praises of this wonderful modern age when there were cities on the Moon and cures for baldness, but what he said was:<br/><br/>  “No, boy. I am the saddest wretch that liveth, in this most unnatural life of mine.”<br/><br/>  “Oh. I’m sorry,” Alec replied, coming close to lean on the stage. “What’s wrong?”<br/><br/>  “I am a slave here, lad,” Will replied.<br/><br/>  “What’s a slave?”<br/><br/>  “A living soul kept as property by others, to labor for them eternally.”<br/><br/>  “But I thought you were dead a long</td>

You can’t even make ‘em in cyberspace?”<br/><br/>  “Cyber space?” Will lifted his head and stared at the boy. “A space cybertechnological, you mean?<br/><br/>  Or what do you mean?”<br/><br/>  “It’s like—look. You’re right here, but you’re not really here,” said Alec, pointing to him. “Where you really are is in the system. Where’s your controls?”<br/><br/>  “I know not—” Will held his hands wide, signifying bewilderment. Alec, pink with anger, was stamping along the front of the stage searching for something. At last he climbed up on the stage, ignoring the signs that forbade him doing so, and spotting the trap door that had once let ghosts rise out of the depths he fell to his knees beside it. Will scrambled to his feet and followed, looking down.<br/><br/>  “I bet they’re in here,” said Alec. He reached into his coat and, looking around furtively, drew out a small case. It looked quite a bit like a thief’s set of picklocks that Will had once seen in his less prosperous days. Alec noticed his astounded stare.<br/><br/>  “Just my tools,” he said in a small voice. “You won’t tell?”<br/><br/>  “Nay, boy, not I!” Will vowed. He watched as Alec lifted out the trap to reveal, not the hollow dark he had thought was below but a sort of shallow cavity full of winking lights and bright buttons. He was so surprised he got down on hands and knees beside Alec to look</td>

MEDICAL EMERGENCY!<br/><br/>  The sensors he used to monitor his audience began to chatter at him in a panicky way, informing him that they detected violent seizure activity in Alec’s brain. Will almost shouted for Caitlin, but paused. He had seen folk afflicted with the falling sickness, and Alec did not appear to be having any manner of fit. The boy’s eyes were alert and focused, his hands steady, and he worked swiftly and without the least hesitation as the bright storm raged within his skull.<br/><br/>  Will shrugged and dismissed the sensors’ warning. He had long since observed that even in this fabulous future world, things occasionally malfunctioned. Especially marvels cybertechnological. Presently Alec drew out something between tweezers. It looked like a tiny word in an unknown language, written in pure light.<br/><br/>  “And that’s it,” he said thoughtfully, turning it this way and that. “Funny.”<br/><br/>  “What is it, in God’s name?”<br/><br/>  “It’s your program,” Alec replied. “You’ve got lots and lots in here, but they didn’t give you very much to do.

Mrs. Osbourne too.”<br/><br/>  “What nonsense. I’m dying penniless, unknown, and (I fear) unloved.” Stevenson’s eyes grew moist. “I came such a long way to do it, too. She sent me away! What does she care if I expire in this wilderness?”<br/><br/>  “Louis, Louis, work with me, all right?” Joseph leaned forward, looking earnest. “This is your dream.

Maybe you’ve read about the cinematograph?<br/><br/>  Oh, gee, no, you haven’t.” Joseph consulted his timepiece. “You’ll just miss it. Never mind— So, in the future, we have these exhibitions of our photo-plays and people pay admission to come in and watch them, the same way they’d watch a live play or an opera, with famous players and everything. But since we don’t have to pay live actors or even move scenery, the profit margin for the exhibitor is enormous. See?”<br/><br/>  Stevenson gaped at him a moment before responding. “I was wrong. I apologize. You may or may not be the Devil, but you’re most assuredly a Yankee.”<br/><br/>  “No, no, I’m a dream. Anyway. People are crazy about these photoplays, they’ll watch anything we shoot. We’ve adapted all the great works of literature already. Shakespeare, Dickens, all those guys. So now, my masters are looking for new material, and since you’re such a famous and successful writer they sent me to ask if you’d be interested in a job.”<br/><br/>  “I see.” Stevenson leaned back, stretching out his long legs and crossing them. “Your masters want to adapt one of my wonderful adventure stories for these photo-plays of theirs?”<br/><br/>  “Uh, actually, we’ve already done everything you wrote. Several times.”<br/><br/>  “I should damned well hope I got royalties, then!”<br/><br/>  “Oh, sure, Louis, sure you did. You’re not only famous, you’re rich. Anyway what my masters had in mind was you coming up with something completely new. Never-before-seen. Just like all your other stuff, you know, with that wonderful Robert Louis Stevenson magic, but different. Exclusively under contract for them.”<br/><br/>  “You mean they want me to write a play?” Stevenson looked intrigued.<br/><br/>  “Not exactly. We don’t have the time. This dream isn’t going to last long enough for you to do that, because it’s a matter of historical record that you’re only going to lie here another—” Joseph consulted his timepiece again, “—forty-three hours before you’re found and nursed back to health. No, see, all they need you to do is develop a story treatment for them. Four or five pages, a plot, characters. You don’t have to do the dialogue; we’ll fill that out as we film. We can claim it’s from long-lost notes found in a locked desk you used to own, or something.”<br/><br/>  “This is madness.” Stevenson sipped his tea experimentally.<br/><br/>  “Delirium. But what have you got to lose? All you have to do is comeup with a concept and develop it. You don’t even have to write it down. I’ll do that for you. And to tell you the honest truth—” Joseph leaned down confidentially, “—this is a specially commissioned work. There’s this wealthy admirer of yours in the place I come from, and he’s willing to pay anything to see a new Robert Louis Stevenson picture.”<br/><br/>  “Wouldn’t he pay more for a whole novel? I could make one up as we go along and dictate the whole thing to you, if we’ve got two more days here. You’d be surprised at how quickly stories unfold when the muse is with me.” Stevenson squinted thoughtfully up at the stars through the branches of the oak tree. Joseph looked slightly embarrassed. “He’s… not really much of a reader, Louis. But he loves our pictures, and he’s rich.”</td>

Now, Evening Primrose Oil from the yellow flower has a number of recognized medical uses, such as being the only substance known to help sufferers of Laurent’s Syndrome, that terrible crippler of the twenty-first century. Thanks to a unique and.complex protein, it helps retard the decay of those oh-so-important genitourinary nerve sheaths afflicted by Laurent’s.

He resembled a naked lunatic trying to tunnel out of an asylum. That didn’t matter, though, in light of the fascinating data Lewis was picking up as he scanned Petrie’s brain activity. It looked like a lightning storm, especially through the frontal lobes. There were connections being made that were not ordinarily made in a mortal mind. Patterns in data were instantly grasped and analyzed, fundamental organizational relationships perceived that mortals did not, as a rule, perceive, and jumps of logic of dazzling clarity followed. Lewis was enchanted. He watched the cerebral fireworks display, noted theslight depression in one temple and pondered the possibility of early brain trauma rerouting Petrie’s neural connections in some marvelous inexplicable way…<br/><br/>  “I must say, sir, this is a great honor for me,” said Lewis hesitantly. “Meeting and actually working with a man of your extraordinary</td>

He was surveying the wreckage of the wall with leonine fury, and the fact that he was wearing a pink singlet, pink ballet tutu and pink ribboned slippers did nothing to detract from the terror of his anger. Nor did the rifle he was aiming at Lewis’s head.<br/><br/>  “Come out of there, you little bastard,” he said. “Look at the mess you’ve made!”<br/><br/>  “I’m sorry!” said Lewis.<br/><br/>  “Not as sorry as you’re going to be,” the old mortal told him. “I knew you were a damned marauder from the moment I laid eyes on you.” He settled the rifle more securely on his shoulder. “Though I couldn’t fathom the rest of it. What’s a super-cyborg? What the hell are you, eh?” Lewis raced mentally through possible believable answers, and decided on:<br/><br/>  “I’m afraid you’re right. I’m a thief; I was paid a lot of money by a certain French count to bring back antiquities for his collection. The Comte de la, er, Cyborg. He ordered me to infiltrate your expedition, because everyone knows you’re the best—”<br/><br/>  “Ballocks,” said Petrie. “I mean what are you?” Lewis blinked at him. “What?” he repeated.<br/><br/>  “What kind of thing are you? You’re no human creature, that much is obvious,” said Petrie.<br/><br/>  “It is?” In spite of his horror, Lewis was fascinated. He scanned Petrie’s brain activity and found it a roiling wasps’ nest of sparks.<br/><br/>  “It is to me, boy,” said Petrie. “Mosquitoes won’t bite you, for one thing. You speak like an actor on the stage, for another. You move like a machine, mathematically exact. I’ve timed the things you do.”<br/><br/>  “What kinds of things?” Lewis asked, delighted.<br/><br/>  “Blinking once every thirty seconds precisely, for example,” said Flinders Petrie. “Except in moments when you’re pretending to be surprised, as you were just now. But there’s not much that surprises you, is there? You knew about this shaft, you very nearly dragged Ali to this spot and showed him where to dig. It was so we’d do all the work for you, wasn’t it? And then you’d make off with whatever was inside.”<br/><br/>  “Well, I’m afraid I—”<br/><br/>  “You’re not afraid. Your pupils aren’t dilating as a man’s would,” said Petrie relentlessly. “You haven’t changed color, and you’re breathing in perfect mechanical rhythm.” But his own hand shook slightly as he pulled back the hammer on the rifle. “You’re some kind of brilliantly complicated automaton, though I’m damned if I can think who made you.”<br/><br/>  “That’s an insane idea, you know,” said Lewis, gauging how much space there was between Petrie and the side of the shaft. “People will think you’re mad as a hatter if you tell anyone.” Petrie actually chuckled. “Do I look like a man who cares if people think I’m mad?” he said. He cut a bizarre little jete, pink slippers flashing. “It’s bloody useful, in fact, to be taken for a lunatic. Why d’you think I keep this ensemble in my kit?

Threw a spanner into your plans, did it?” He had apparently traveled in his pink ballet ensemble, though he’d sensibly put on boots for the journey; his slippers hung around his neckby their ribbons, like a dancer in a painting by Degas. Nor had he come alone; behind him stood Ali and several of the other fellaheen, and they were carrying clubs.<br/><br/>  “Look, I’m sorry, but you must have realized by now the sarcophagus was a fake!” said Lewis. “What in Jove’s name do you want?”<br/><br/>  “It may be a fake, but it’s a three-thousand-year-old fake, and I want to know how it was done,” said Petrie imperturbably. “I’m still wearing my insanity defense; so you’d best start talking.”<br/><br/>  “What is this?” Lady Kiu strode around the motorcar and stopped, looking at the scene in some amusement and much contempt. “Lewis, don’t tell me you’ve broken the heart of an elderly transvestite.” Petrie lifted his head to glare at her, and then his eyes widened.</td>

<td>And when you’re dead inside, like me, Lewis dear, and not until then—you’ll be free. But you won’t care anymore.”<br/><br/>  She kissed him and, rising, made her exit.<br/><br/>  Alone, Lewis sat staring after her a moment before shrugging resolutely.<br/><br/>  He opened the champagne and poured his solitary glass. His hair was already beginning to grow back, and the retina of his left eye had almost completely reattached. And, look! There was the rising sun streaming in through the blinds, and green papyrus waved on the river bank, and pyramids and crocodiles were all over the place. The ancient Nile! The romance of Egypt!<br/><br/>  He had even been shot at by Flinders Petrie.<br/><br/>  Lewis sipped his champagne and selected a scroll from the cache. Not The Book of the Forces that Repel Matter; that was all very fascinating in its way, and would in time guarantee that Americans would rediscover antigravity (once they got around to deciphering a certain scroll, long forgotten in a museum basement), but it wasn’t his idea of treasure.<br/><br/>  He took out the Story qf Sinuhe and opened it, marveling at its state of preservation. Settling back in his chair, he drank more champagne and gradually lost himself in the first known novel. He savored the words of mortal men. The Nile bore him away.</td>

<td>Also known as Amazonian Dark Earth,” said Mendoza, in a seductive sort of voice. “Super-compost. Occurs near ancient settlement sites but not even the Indians know where it comes from. Reproduces itself, like sourdough yeast. Bury some in lousy rain forest soil and it’ll convert it to arable land. One of those answer-to-world-hunger things about which mortals will never quite get a clue.”<br/></td>

<td>selecting our winner?”<br/>“Certainly, sir.” Victor stepped up to the bowl and delved in, stirring the tokens.<br/>“Suspense suspense suspense suspense suspense suspense,” chanted the Mayan waiters, until Victor drew out a single piece of jade. He held it up with a flourish, and then read aloud what was engraved thereon:<br/>“Nine Flower Monkey Rain Cloud!”<br/>A moment of hurried clicking, like a roomful of scorpions, as the immortals grabbed up their jade tiles and examined them. Lewis looked around, waiting for someone’s exclamation of triumph.<br/>“Hell,” said Mendoza. “I’ve got Nine Flower Jaguar Stone Star.” She looked across at Lewis. “Aren’t you going to check yours?”<br/>“Oh, I never win these things—great Caesar’s ghost!” Lewis stared at his tile, unbelieving. “Nine Flower Monkey Rain Cloud! Oh! Oh, my gosh!”<br/>“We have a winner!” shouted the majordomo, seizing Lewis’s hand and holding it up.<br/>“Olé!” cried Mendoza, applauding. “Lewis, you can go to Paris! Rome! London! Bravo!”<br/>And his fellow immortals joined in the applause, and Director General Houbert himself condescended to come forward to shake his hand, but as the roaring wave of congratulation broke over him all Lewis saw was Mendoza’s face, bright and happy for once, and for him.<br/> <br/>He had</td>
